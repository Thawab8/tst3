"name: Unfinished Ring with Flat Bead,Egyptian"
Description: One side of the bead bears a detailed carving of an owl, a hieroglyph that has the same sound value as the English ""m."" The other side
shows a victorious pharaoh raising his weapon to dispatch a cowering enemy. The plaque was probably created in the 18th or 19th
Dynasty.



"name: Ancient Art Spacer with Cartouche of Amenophis III,Egyptian"
Description: This piece is a faience spacer bead with three rounded tubes joined by a plate in the shape of a cartouche. The tubes have rounded holes
in them for the strings of a three row necklace or bracelet. It has a white background and the outline of the cartouche and the hieroglyphs
within it are worked in a violet glaze. The name represented is the throne name of Pharoah Amenophis III, Neb-maat-re. The tan faience
fabric may be seen along the upper edge where the glaze has been worn away.



"name: Ancient Art Plaque with Figural Scene,Egyptian-Islamic"
Description:This pentagonal plaque depicts a running man and his dog, and probably formed part of the decorative inlay of a piece of furniture. The
animation of the running figures is typical of Islamic art in Egypt during the Fatimid period (909-1171), when objects of all kinds were
decorated with very realistic representations.



"name: Islamic Art Ichneumon Statuette,Egyptian"
Description: Forepaws raised in adoration, this ichneumon (a type of mongoose) was a votive gift to the cobra-goddess Wadjet. The dedication to her
of a snake-eating mongoose may seem ironic, but it is in keeping with Egyptian concepts of association. The inscription on the base
names the donor.



"name: Ancient Art Scarab with a Human Face,Egyptian"
Description: The ancient Egyptians believed that the dung beetle, the Scarabaeus sacer, was one of the manifestations of the sun god.
Representations of these beetles were used as amulets, and for ritual or administrative purposes. The head of this scarab is carved as a
human face, the rest of the body as a beetle. The highest point of the back is the pronotum (dorsal plate of the prothorax), and two side-
notches at shoulder height define the partition between pronotum and elytron (wing cases). The proportions of the top are almost
balanced, but the head section protrudes into the pronotum. The raised, slender extremities have natural form and diagonal hatch lines on
the upper sides for the tibial teeth and pilosity (hair); the background between the legs is hollowed out. The long-oval base is symmetrical,
and the drill-holes are framed. The bottom design displays a line with three hieroglyphs: the bee (""kingship"") in the center, flanked by
two nfr-signs (""perfection""). The hieroglyphs are enclosed by eight interlocked Z-shaped spiral scrolls, two elongated horizontally on
each length side, two elongated diagonally (with different orientations) on the short sides; the arrangement is framed by an oval line. The
numeric arrangement of the spiral scrolls is: 2+2+2+2 = 8. The layout of the bottom design is well organized, and the line flow almost
regular. The scarab is longitudinally pierced, was originally mounted or threaded, and functioned as an amulet with kingship and good luck
connotation. It should ensure royal support (bee), good luck (nfr), and total renewal (8 spiral scrolls). The combination of scarab body and
human face may indicate the transformation process of the renewing sun god. Erik Hornung and Elizabeth Staehelin comment to scarabs
with human heads that they base on the Egyptian tendency of personification and anthropomorphism. Nevertheless, it seems obvious that
this form represents a special aspect of the sun god. Images of Khepri since the New Kingdom in the books of the underworld show
either the pure scarab or a mummified human body with scarab instead of a head; there is also the combination of beetle body and ram
head, e.g. in the sixth part of the Book of Caverns, but no one with human face. The human head of scarab amulets could refer to
different divine aspects (such as Atum or Osiris), but an interpretation as the face of the solar child seems the most likely one.



"name: Ancient Art Standing Man,Egyptian"
Description: This sculpture is of a man standing with both hands clenched at his sides. He has a shaven head. and is wearing ribbed skirt. He has a
cloth in his right hand. There is an inscription on the base.

"name: Ancient Art Sculptor's Model with Fragment of a Figural Scene,Egyptian"
Description: The authenticity of this piece has been questioned.



"name: Ancient Art Ushabti,Egyptian"
This figure has long hair painted black. The eyes are also black. In the right hand is a hoe, and in the left is a mattock. Behind each
shoulder is a sack. The inscription claims the piece is made for ""the scribe, Nwfy."" Then follows the regular ushabti formula.



"name: Ancient Art Priest Teti with His Family,Egyptian"
Description: Teti the priest was the principal owner of this group statue. In keeping with artistic conventions, he is placed in the center, larger than the
two other figures, and receives their supportive gestures. The smaller man is Teti's father, also named Teti, while the woman is the elder
Teti's wife, Meket. The reference to the god Ptah of ancient Memphis in the inscription on the front of the younger Teti's kilt suggests that
the sculpture may have been dedicated in a temple there. This association with Memphis might also account for the statue's unusual
pyramid-like shape, as a similarly shaped sacred monument, called the ""benben,"" was worshiped in the region.



"name: Ancient Art Titi Seated on the Ground,Egyptian"
Description: This sculpture is carved in the round. It has an inscription on the front. It depicts a figure with hands on knees wearing a full wig with the
ears not obscured.

Description: This mummiform figure has folded arms. In the right is a mattock with a cord to a sack behind the figure's left shoulder. In the left hand is a
hoe. The figure's eyes are painted, and there is a painted inscription on the front.



"name: Ancient Art Head of King,Egyptian"
Description: The king wears the royal ""nemes"" head cloth adorned with a coiled uraeus serpent on the brow. A confident smile, crisply defined eyes,
and a sense of detachment and self-satisfaction are common in the facial features of Ptolemaic Period sculptures.



"name: Ancient Art Vase with Names of Amenhotep III and Queen Tiye,Egyptian"
Description: Royalty of the 18th Dynasty commissioned luxury goods in glazed faience and glass. Vessels bearing royal names could have been
reserved for royal use or given as gifts to worthy subjects or visitors to the court. This vase contains the names of King Amenophis
(Amenhotep) III and Queen Tiye. This small vase was once a part of the MacGregor collection. The vessel's shape imitates a bag or a
sack. It was a popular shape during the 18th Dynasty in pottery, stone, painted wood (to imitate stone), as well as faience. The bottom of
the vessel is flat allowing it to stand freely on a flat surface. The flat top of the vessel could have originally been closed by a similarly
shaped flat lid, as is seen in many examples dating to the 18th Dynasty. The faience most probably incorporates cobalt mixed with copper
for the rich, dark-blue color. Before the 18th Dynasty, blue was produced with copper, however, during the 18th Dynasty cobalt mixed
with copper was introduced. Cobalt is not attributable to any region or site from the time of Amenophis (Amenhotep) III. The vessel shows
a dark residue on the inside. Although chemical analysis has not yet been performed to determine what kind of substance the vessel
contained, it is possible that it originally contained some kind of expensive cosmetic, possibly kohl, oil, or perfume.



"name: Ancient Art Scarab Amulet,Egyptian"
Description: The ancient Egyptians believed that the dung beetle, the Scarabaeus sacer, was one of the manifestations of the sun god.
Representations of these beetles were used as amulets, and for ritual or administrative purposes. The bottom of this scarab displays the
figure of kneeling prisoner with his arms fettered behind the back. He wears a headband with curled ends, a collar around his neck, and a
short kilt with belt; a large nfr-sign is placed in front of him. The figure of the captive dominates the scene, but the size and placement of
the nfr-sign, which counterbalances the fettered arms of the captive, clarifies that he is part of a perfectly controlled situation. The highest
point of the back is pronotum (dorsal plate of the prothorax) and elytron (wing cases). Both parts have incised borderlines, a thick, curved
partition line, and a thick line between the wing cases. The semicircular head is flanked by triangular eyes; the plates are irregularly
trapezoidal, and clypeus has two very small central base marks. The proportions of the top are slightly unbalanced, the head and clypeus
slightly short, and the pronotum large in comparison to the elytron. The slender extremities have natural form, and diagonal hatch lines on
the frontlegs for the tibial teeth. The oval base is somewhat asymmetrical and smaller at the head part. The scarab is longitudinally
pierced, was originally mounted or threaded, and probably served as an amulet. It refers to perfect control of chaotic elements (enemy),
and is possibly a statement of the victory over the Kerma Empire. Such an amulet should protect its owner from danger. It is imaginable
that the soldiers who protected the southern borders or participated in military campaigns to the south used it. The iconography of the
prisoner makes it possible that he represents a man from Kerma, the southern enemy of the Egyptians. The understanding of the figure
as hieroglyph for ""enemy, rebel"" is also possible, but it is more likely that it is a specific icon for the enemies of Kerma, who are now
""perfect,"" because Thutmose I had defeated them.



"name: Ancient Art Mummified Human Remains of a Woman Inside a Painted Cartonnage,Egyptian"
Description: Mummification preserved mortal remains in order to house the Ka, or life force of the individual, as it needed to return to the body to find
sustenance. The human-shaped covering, called ""cartonnage,"" is composed of layers of linen and plaster. Its painted decoration
includes the floral wreath on the wig, a broad collar, and a winged scarab beetle. Five additional registers of decoration show the
protective four sons of Horus, the sacred boat of the funerary-deity Sokar, a depiction of Osiris mummified on a funerary bed, a divine
falcon god, and a short hieroglyphic text with an offering formula. See the additional media for a facial reconstruction of the deceased
person, courtesy of Michael Brassell, as well as a color reconstruction of the cartonnage.



"name: Ancient Art Earring,Islamic,,Medieval Art Offering Table,Egyptian"
Description: The offering table was an essential element of the funerary cult and was usually placed near the deceased's tomb in an offering niche or
chapel. If the cult ceased to function, the carved images of food and drink on the table served as magical substitutes, thus insuring the
survival of the deceased's ka, or spirit.



"name: Ancient Art Scarab with a Royal Title,Egyptian"
Description: This steatite scarab is inscribed on the bottom with the ""two royal aspects"" title and the basic component of the unification icon (the
plants of Upper and Lower Egypt). The top of the scarab is high and simple with carved details. The workmanship of the piece is good,
and it is carefully made. This amulet has kingship connotations, and was originally mounted or threaded. The royal title and the unification
icon refer both the the association of the dualistic aspects of kingship and state, as well as of the whole creation. The amulet should
provide its owner with royal support and guarantee a stable and well-organized environment. The unification icon also has a renewal
connotation. The combined use of the title and icon is much less common than the icon alone. The five times serration of the clypeus of
the scarab is rare, and does not have many parallels.



"name: Ancient Art Fragment in Sunk Relief of Female Deity Bearing Offerings,Egyptian"
Description: These two (together with Walters 22.100) well-preserved painted relief sculptures originally belonged to a depiction of a procession of
gods, who represented the 42 nomes, or regions, of Egypt. They once decorated the lower part of the southeast wall of the First Hall,
containing eight columns, within a temple dedicated to the god Osiris, built at Abydos by Ramesses II. The lower portion of both figures
remains in place in the Ramesses temple, where they are exposed to the elements. The reliefs shown here, however, have retained their
vivid color. The deities bring offerings for the cult of Osiris in Ramesses' name. Their faces follow the portrait style of Ramesses II, with
oval eyes, slightly hollowed eyelids, a small mouth, and a prominent, beaked nose. Note the remains of the hieroglyph above each
figure's head, indicating that he or she is the personification of a region. The raised area of these nome-signs retains red pigment. A
portion of the abundant offerings the male deity bears is preserved. His blue skin associates him with the forces of creation. Original
pigments also include yellow on the female deity's face, blue on her wig, and light green on the plant stalks she holds in her right hand.



"name: Ancient Art Inlay with the Face of a Deity,Egyptian,,Ancient Art Ushabti,Egyptian"
Description: This ushabti has long hair and wears a red-painted necklace. It has folded arms with tools incised in the right hand including a hoe and a
sack. In the left is a mattock and a sack. There is nothing on the back. An inscription runs in horizontal bands on the front. This is a stock
figure sold by the undertaker ready to order. The places where the names go are left blank, the name of the deceased is to be inserted
when it is ordered by the bereaved family.

"name: Ancient Art Scarab,Egyptian"
Description: This scarab has a flat underside without a bottom design. The design of the back is very detailed with fine incised hatch marks and
shoulder marks, and irregular line flow. The proportions of the top are well balanced. The workmanship is excellent and the piece is
elaborately made. The scarab functioned as a funerary amulet with a renewal connotation, and could have been an inlay of a pectoral or a
heart scarab. The piece was originally mounted or threaded.



"name: Ancient Art Scarab with the Throne Name of Thutmosis III,Egyptian"
Description: This scarab has a flat underside and an inscription on the bottom. The piece is incised with sunk relief details and is glazed. The design of
the back is very detailed, with deeply incised thick lines and careful workmanship. This piece functioned as an individualized amulet and
was originally mounted or threaded. The amulet should secure the divine status for the king (Thutmosis III) and provide a private owner
with his royal patronage.


"name: Ancient Art Scarab with Personal Wish Formula,Egyptian"
Description: This steatite scarab has a flat underside with a vertically arranged bottom inscription with a personal wish formula. The top of the piece
has a very detailed, deeply incised design with slightly irregular line flow and almost balanced proportions. The workmanship is good and
the piece is simply made. The piece functioned as a provider individualized amulet and should provide its owner with the special support
of the goddess Bastet. It originally would have been mounted or threaded.



"name: Ancient Art Ring,Egyptian"
Description: Blue faience ring of flimsy construction with crudely incised hieroglyphs which refer to the new god Aten of the Amarna revolution.



"name: Ancient Art Bowl with Fish and Lotuses,Egyptian"
Description: Shallow faience bowls of this type were particularly popular during the early to mid-18th Dynasty. Faience was a commonly used material
in Egypt; it was made from silica--found for example in quartz pebbles, sand, or lime--and formed in a mold. Its blue or turquoise glaze
came from inclusions of copper as a colorant. This bowl was molded over a hemispherical form and then glazed and fired. The dark
purple decoration, often added to monochrome faience pieces, was painted before firing with a manganese-based pigment. These
vessels (sometimes described as ""marsh bowls"") are typically embellished with aquatic imagery with allusions to fertility, such as tilapia
fish, lotuses, papyrus umbels, buds on stems, and pools of water. The bright blue of faience, as well as the aquatic motifs adorning these
bowls is associated with the life-giving qualities of cool, fresh water. The blue lotus (Nymphaea caerulea), and the tilapia fish (Tilapia
nilotica) are emblematic of such imagery. Here, two fish carry lotus stems with buds and opened blossoms in their mouths. The
ornamentation relates to the powerful themes of rebirth and regeneration.



"name: Ancient Art Figure of a Lion-Headed Goddess in Front of an Obelisk,Egyptian"
Description: The ancient Egyptians donated figures of their gods for use in temple rituals; smaller images served as amulets to ensure divine
protection. Goddesses in particular were viewed as protective deities. From earliest times, Egyptian venerated a wide circle of feline-
headed female deities, such as Sakhmet, Tefnut, Wadjet, and Bastet. Leonine goddesses, usually Sakhmet or Wadjet (daughters of the
sun-god Re), were often associated with an obelisk - a symbol of the sun god - demonstrating both their close relationship to the supreme
god and his powers of renewal.



"name: Ancient Art Head of a Male Statue,Egyptian"
Description: This head was part of a statue that was most likely placed in a temple to allow its owner to participate in the rituals for the gods and the
king. The name of the man is lost, but his shaven head suggests that he was a priest.



",Ancient Art Dagger and Sheath,Islamic,,Islamic Art """Senet"" Board"name: Egyptian"
Description: Egyptians enjoyed playing board games, especially senet, or ""passing."" During the 18th dynasty, the game acquired religious
significance, which transformed it into a simulation of the soul's journey through the underworld to achieve immortality. Throw sticks,
much like dice, determined a player's moves, and winning required both skill and luck. This senet game board of 30 squares required 14
game pieces, like these spool- and cone-shaped pieces.



"name: Ancient Art Seated Servant,Egyptian"
Description: This statuette is part of a group. It depicts a seated servant with his left knee raised and his right foot tucked behind his left. The arms are
joined at the shoulders, and both are missing.



"name: Ancient Art Horus Stele (Cippus),Egyptian"
Description: This cippus is carved in low relief. It depicts, on a panel, Horus the child holding a gazelle, a lion, snakes, and a scorpion. There are
inscriptions on the sides and back. There is a head of Bes at the top with a hole for suspension through the head.



"name: Ancient Art Lion Headed Nefertem,Egyptian"
Description: The seated figure represents a nude child god. The crown on his head depicts a lotus bud. The opened lotus flower is an attribute of the
god Nefertem, the son of the creator god Ptah and the lioness goddess Sakhmet. This variation of Nefertem with a lotus bud is a rare
example.


"name: Ancient Art Relief Fragment Showing a Priest with an Incense Burner,Egyptian"
Description: A mortuary priest, traditionally clothed in animal skin and long kilt, performs the ""Opening of the Mouth"" ritual, an essential part of the
funeral ceremony in which the mummy is restored to life. Behind the priest is a table with special tools for the rites. He makes an offering
and burns incense before the upright mummy (missing). This finely sculpted fragment comes from the tomb of the vizier Nes-pa-ka-shuty,
a government official whose power was second only to that of the king (TT 312). It demonstrates the elegant style of the 26th Dynasty.



"name: Ancient Art Scarab of Neferu-Re,Egyptian"
Description: The ancient Egyptians believed that the dung beetle, the Scarabaeus sacer, was one of the manifestations of the sun god.
Representations of these beetles were used as amulets, and for ritual or administrative purposes. This small, red carnelian scarab has a
vertically arranged bottom inscription, which consists of three lines of right reading text with a cartouche in the center. An oval line frames
the inscription. The text contains the name and title of crown princess Neferure, daughter of the female pharaoh Hatshepsut, and a
formula whishing her life. The highest point of the back is the pronotum (dorsal plate of the prothorax). Pronotum and elytron (wing cases)
have fine single borderlines and double separations lines. The line flow almost regular, only the partition lines between pronotum and
elytron overlap slightly. The trapezoidal head is flanked by quarter-ovoid eyes. The trapezoidal side plates have curved outer edges, and
the clypeus (front plate), which is very large in comparison to the head, has four frontal serrations and a central base notch. The
extremities show natural form and vertical hatch lines for the tibial teeth and pilosity (hair), the background between the legs is deeply
hollowed out. The oval base is symmetrical. The scarab is longitudinally pierced, and was originally mounted or threaded. It functions as a
name seal and user-individualized amulet of crown princess Neferure. The scarab should secure the individual existence (wish formula:
""who may live""), divine relation (title: ""divine consort""), and royal status (cartouche) of the crown princess, and the red color her magic
protection. The material, carnelian, was especially used for protective amulets and the Egyptians believed that it would intensify the
magical potency. The scarab could have been a personal amulet of the princess, but, it is also possible that it was given to a private
person to guarantee the crown princess' patronage. Scarabs made of dark red carnelian were popular for the female members of the
court in early 18th Dynasty.



"name: Ancient Art Amulet of Pataikos on Crocodiles,Egyptian"
Description: This dwarf-like, protective deity was very popular in ancient Egypt; amulets in the shape of this god were particularly popular from the
Third Intermediate period. The Greek name Pataikos comes from a passage in the writings of Herodotus (ca. 5th century BCE), who used
this term to describe a Phoenician protective dwarf-like image. The Egyptian Pataikos is a special manifestation of the creator god Ptah
and the dwarf-like appearance symbolizes his magical power. This amulet displays a very special variant of Pataikos representations
which links this god to images of the juvenile god Horus standing on crocodiles. Here, Pataikos also stands on two antithetically arranged
crocodiles. He has snakes in his hands and a scarab on top of his head. On each of his shoulders was once a falcon, both of which are
now broken off. The goddesses Isis and Nephthys are standing at his sides, and at his back another representation of Isis protects the
Pataikos figure with her wings. In this special arrangement the magical power of Pataikos is linked to the Horus myth.



"name: Ancient Art Comb,Egyptian"
Description: This comb carved from a single piece of wood, possibly Sycamore Fig. There are thirty flat rectangular teeth. The two outermost teeth are
slightly wider than the others and are rounded on the outer edges. The comb is rectangular in shape and the upper edge is rounded. It is
modestly decorated with three rectangular projections along the top edge and two pairs of straight incised lines located just below the
projections and just above the top of the teeth. This type of decoration is typical for simple combs of the 18th Dynasty. Several of the
teeth are broken and there are surface stains from water or some other liquid. The multitude of scratches on the surface of the wood
suggest that the object was actually used during the life of its owner. Combs like this were probably used for one's natural hair, rather than
for the elaborate wigs of the New Kingdom that required special instruments.



"name: Ancient Art Statue of a Standing Khonsu,Egyptian"
Description: Khonsu could be represented either as a youth or a falcon-headed male with a moon-disk and crescent on his head, as here. He is
mentioned as a moon god in the pyramid texts as early as the 3rd millennium BCE. As the son of Amun and Mut he was worshipped in
Karnak where he had his own temple from the Middle Kingdom onwards.



"name: Ancient Art Situla with Erased Cartouche of Akhenaten,Egyptian"
Description: Situlae were vessels used to pour offerings of milk or water in purification rituals. They take the form of a human breast and were
associated with the goddess Isis. Situlae were found in temple treasuries at Amarna, the city built by the pharaoh Akhenaten to honor
Aten, the sun-disk deity. This vessel continued to be used after the demise of Akhenaten and the king's birth name has been erased. It
has a central field containing three columns of inscription executed in dark blue glaze.



"name: Ancient Art Amulet with the Names of Amenophis III (1388-1351/1350 BCE) and Queen Tiye,Egyptian"
Description: This symmetrically carved long oval plaque has sunk relief inscriptions on both the front and back of the piece. The front has the throne
name of Amenophis III (1388-1351/1350 BCE). The reverse lists the name and royal title of the Queen Tiye. The workmanship on the
piece is good, and it is simply made. The plaque functioned as a individualized amulet, and was originally mounted, probably as part of a
finger ring. The amulet should secure the special role of Queen Tiye, and assure the royal patronage of king and queen for its owner. In
addition, it is likely that this royal couple were considered to be successful mediators to the gods, especially to Amun-Re. There are many
examples of plaques and scarabs with the names Amenophis III and his wife Tiye, found in and outside of Egypt. The possibility of
reading the throne name as an Amun's trigram increases the magical value of the amulet.



"name: Ancient Art Horus Falcon,Egyptian"
Description: The representation of a falcon was related to Horus, god of Kingship, but also to the sun god Re. Beside there are many local gods who
are represented as falcons without a crown or inscription identification is impossible.



"name: Ancient Art Libyan AppliquÃ©,Egyptian"
Description: To reinforce their power visually, Egyptian royal monuments often displayed depictions of groups of foreigners bound as prisoners or in
defensive positions while Egyptian sovereigns attacked. Representatives of various Nubian groups were frequently included, along with
Babylonians, Libyans, Syrians, Hittites, Canaanites, Philistines, Amorites, and even Greeks. While some nations were conquered and
captured, others were vassal states that offered tribute or were bound to Egypt by diplomatic treaties. To depict the foreign groups,
Egyptian artists standardized their clothing and hairstyles into set â€œtypesâ€​ and emphasized any perceived physical differences from
Egyptians. In the case of this appliquÃ©, which was probably attached to an object bleonging to the king, the bands crossed over the
chest, the long hair (which originally had a side-lock), and the short beard identify the individual as a Libyan.



"name: Ancient Art Isis Nursing Horus,Egyptian"
Description: A lapis lazuli amulet representing the goddess Isis seated on a throne decorated with a scale pattern. She holds her left breast and raises
the head of infant Horus on her lap. The broad face and squat proportions may indicate an early date. The back is perforated at shoulder
level.



"name: Ancient Art Amun,Egyptian"
Description: This cast silver amulet with a poor surface represents the great national god Amun, standing with the left foot directly in front of the right.
The lines of his short kilt, necklace, armlets and bracelets are indicated by incision. There is a large suspension loop behind the (broken)
plume on his cap. The heavy-featured face suggests this may be a provincial piece.



"name: Ancient Art Dwarf Scaraboid,Egyptian"
Description: Oval plaques with images of humans or animals instead of a scarab beetle are named ""scaraboid."" This small example shows a female
(?) dwarf executed in high relief. The bottom inscription has the name of the god Amun-Re enclosed by the stems of two lotus plants with
buds. The amulet should provide its owner with magic protection and the regenerative support of Amun-Re.



"name: Ancient Art Scarab Ring,Egyptian"
Description: This ring, a less expensive version of Walters 57.1957, is composed of a glazed steatite scarab set in a wide bronze band. It is attached
to a hoop which tapers into a wire small enough to go through the perforation of the scarab. Decorative hieroglyphs are carved into the
flat face of the back of the scarab. Above is the red crown flanked by ""protection"" symbols, below is a ""djed"" pillar of Osiris flanked by
signs in the shape of a basket.



",Ancient Art "Female Figure, Possibly with Dwarfism"name: Egyptian"
Description: This carefully carved plump female figure has short limbs, a large head with short curly hair, and large breasts. A deep hole marks the
navel. The wide pubic triangle is marked by holes. There is a depression on top of the buttocks. On the head is a large lotus blossom. A
ball surrounded by ridges has been inserted into the hollow lotus to form the calyx of the flower.



"name: Ancient Art Model of a Composite Capital with Grid on the Top,Egyptian"
Description: This sculptor's model depicts a papyrus capital with additional pointed leaves. There are incised squares on top of the abacus.



"name: Ancient Art King,Egyptian"
Description: Both continuity and change are reflected in this portrait bust initially carved for a ruler of the Middle Kingdom and then re-carved for a New
Kingdom monarch. There was a marked change between the way late 12th Dynasty and mid 19th Dynasty kings were represented. The
pharaohs of the 12th Dynasty wished to present an experienced and careworn expression. This is conveyed by heavy eyelids, wrinkles,
and a firm set to the mouth. The pharaohs of the 19th Dynasty, however, wanted their images to suggest youth, vigor, and confidence. To
transform a Middle Kingdom royal image into a New Kingdom one, sculptors re-carved the face. The eyes, nose, and forehead of this
sculpture show evidence of reworking to erase signs of age, while the corners of the mouth were deeply drilled to make the cheeks
appear rounder and to bring the lips closer to the slight smile typical of 19th Dynasty royal sculpture.



"name: Ancient Art Plaque,Islamic"
Description: This plaque was probably originally set into a piece of furniture in a madrasa, or theological college, built by Sultan Qaitbay (1467-1496),
ruler of the Mamluk Dynasty and an active patron of the arts. The inscription in ""thuluth"" script is an invocation based on two verses of
the Qur'an (from ""sura,"" or chapter, 74). It reads: ""Night and day have mixed in the enjoyment of it.""
Description: 

"name: Islamic Art Star Tile with Combat Scene,Iranian-Islamic"
Description: The Persian verses written around the outer blue band come from the Shahnama (Book of Kings), the national epic of Iran, and
specifically from a section of the text that recounts the tragic combat between the great hero Rustam and his son Sohrab. It is unlikely,
however, that the two men fighting in the center of this tile are meant to illustrate the Shahnama text.



"name: Islamic Art Box for Ushabtis or Canopic Jars,Egyptian"
Description: During the New Kingdom, ushabti figures were often placed in a painted wooden box shaped like a shrine. Only the sides of this box are
preserved, and it may have held a number of ushabti figures or a set of canopic jars. The deities associated with death and the afterlife
are represented on the box's panels. There is the figure of a jackal on top of a shrine, which represents the embalming god Anubis. Isis
and Nephthys flank the large symbol of Osiris and the four sons of Horus. All of the inscriptions are related to the god Osiris.



"name: Ancient Art Scarab with a Sphinx Set in a Swivel Ring,Egyptian"
Description: On the base of this carnelian scarab a sphinx wearing a royal war crown reclines over the body of a fallen enemy.



"name: Ancient Art Amuletic Plaque with Isis,Egyptian"
Description: A trapezoidal shaped faience amulet in the form of a plaque with the raised relief image of the goddess Isis. The goddess kneels upon a
low base and holds her right hand in front of her face in a gesture of morning. She wears a long sheath gown and a tripartite wig. Her
characteristic headdress is actually a hieroglyphic writing of her name: the sign for a throne. Numerous funerary amulets were usually
placed among the many layers of linen strips used to wrap mummies. Specific amulets, along with their required position on the body, are
listed in funerary texts such as ""The Book of the Dead."" Amulets were sometimes sewn directly onto the wrappings or could be
incorporated into a bead net shroud covering the mummy. This amulet has been modeled with a flat underside and is pierced by tiny
holes around the edges for attachment.



"name: Ancient Art Cippus of Horus,Egyptian"
Description: This black steatite cippus is carved in low relief and depicts Horus the child. The piece has two young crocodiles on the base, and the
head of Bes at the top. The figure holds two scorpions, a gazelle, and a lion.



"name: Ancient Art Powder Flask,Islamic"
Description: The decoration of this powder flask, which includes a buck, an antelope, a lion, a bird, a boar, an elephant, and a mongoose, attests to a
fascination with Indiaâ€™s wildlife. With the exception of the elephant, used as a hunting steed, these animals were regularly hunted in
Mughal India. The decoration thus alludes to the objectâ€™s function: flasks holding gunpowder were essential firearm accessories in
royal hunts. The lavishness of the materials, however, which originally included paint and gilding, and the refinement of its execution far
exceed a purely utilitarian function.



"name: Islamic Art Wall Fragment with Enslaved Men Holding Staffs,Egyptian"

is displayed with the standard iconography of Amun-Re. He is dressed in a divine kilt, a collar, and a double feather-crown combined with
a sun-disk.



"name: Ancient Art Sculptor Model for a Royal Bust,Egyptian"
Description: A limestone model bust of a royal male wearing the ""nemes"" headdress with a ""uraeus."" The ""uraeus"" serpent has been broken
away. As was typical for the period, the ""uraeus"" had two coils, one to each side and the tail extended back over the top of the rounded
""nemes."" Beneath the edge of the band of the ""nemes"" the natural hairline of the figure may be seen. The eyes are naturally outlined
and the brow delicately follows the contour of the eye. The pupils and irises of the eyes are picked out in black paint. The surface of the
piece has been scratched and chipped in several places. The face is fleshy and rather flat in profile. The lips are pursed and smiling. The
back, sides and base are flat planes and there are grid squares etched into the back and sides. Where the lappets touch the shoulder
they are creased in an unnaturally sharp way. The lappets are flat with a curved outer edge and strictly vertical inner edge.



"name: Ancient Art Scarab with the Squatting Goddess Maat,Egyptian"
Description: This steatite scarab is carved with a design and inscription on the bottom that signifies divine support and can be interpreted to read three
ways: ""Praised is the Maat of Re,"" ""Favorite of Amun(-Re),"" or ""Praised is the Maat of Amun."" The top of the piece is high and is
carved with a combination of icons and script signs. This design is not standardized and the style is inconsistent. The execution of the
back and bottom differ slightly, the bottom design is more elaborate. It is possible that a different specialist carved the much smaller
figures and script signs of the bottom. This piece functioned as an amulet with royal connotations, and was originally mounted or
threaded. The motif on the back praises the Maat of Amun/Re and the bottom inscription notes the special relation of the Nubian
monarchy to Re and Amun. Furthermore, the presence of Taweret adn Ptah-Sokar-Osiris addresses magic protection and renewal. The
representations of the two royal worshippers may refer to the legitimacy of the Kushite kings, and their responsibility for Egypt and Nubia
granted by Amun. The scarab combines unique motifs and inscriptions, and the question of authenticity has to be raised. Nevertheless,
there is a scarab of the 26th Dynasty, excavated in Acco, which shows a comparable layout, but with very different icons. Furthermore,
the combination fo icons and text on the Walters' scarab is meaningful in the addressed Kushite time frame, and the style consistent.



",Ancient Art "Triad of Isis, Horus and Nephthys"name: Egyptian"
Description: While Egyptian jewelry was worn in daily life, most of the examples known today came from tombs, where they adorned mummies.
Amulets provided magical protection for the wearer in both life and death. The consistent color and workmanship of the 13 light-blue
faience figures of gods owned by the Walters (this one and Walters 48.1676, 48.1677, 48.1679, 48.1684, 48.1701, 48.1702, 48.1704,
48.1705, 48.1708, 48.1709, 48.1710 and 48.1711) suggest that they came from the same workshop. Represented here are Horus the
Child (Harpokrates) flanked by Isis and Nephthys.

"name: Ancient Art Temple Relief of Nectanebo II,Egyptian"
Description: Once decorating the lower section of an interior temple wall, this relief depicts gods carrying offering trays supporting cartouches bearing
the name of King Nectanebo II, and liquid and floral offerings. The deities bring the agricultural wealth of the nome, or region, they
represent in a procession. The hieroglyphic texts praise the king and the god Onuris-Shu. Unlike the sunk relief used on exterior walls,
interior walls were decorated with raised relief.



"name: Ancient Art Scarab,Egyptian"
The ancient Egyptians believed that the dung beetle, the Scarabaeus sacer, was one of the manifestations of the sun god.
Representations of these beetles were used as amulets, and for ritual or administrative purposes. This scarab has a bottom design that
displays King Amenhotep seated on his throne. He is dressed in a long pleated kilt, wears the so-called ""Blue crown"" with Uraeus-
serpent and crown sash. The king holds with his left hand the crook in front of his chest, and with his right an ankh-sign (meaning ""life"").
The block throne has a small back. In front of him is a column with a left reading inscription, containing his throne name and title, and
behind him the hieroglyphs for ""protection"" and ""life."" The layout is well organized, but it is notable that the royal figure does not fill the
whole space, and that the Uraeus on the forehead of the king is unusually large. The highest point of the scarab's back is the pronotum
(dorsal plate of the prothorax). Pronotum and elytron (wing cases) have deeply incised, fine borderlines, single separation lines, V-shaped
marks for the humeral callosities (shoulder thickenings), and small side-depressions. The partition lines between pronotum and elytron
meet V-shaped. The rectangular head is flanked by triangular eyes. The trapezoidal side plates have curved outer edges and borderlines,
and the clypeus (front plate) has four frontal serrations and two central base notches. The raised, slender extremities have natural form;
the background between the legs is deeply hollowed out. The low oval base is symmetrical. The scarab is longitudinally pierced, was
originally mounted or threaded, and functioned as an amulet. It secures the existence (""life""), protection, divinity (title: ""Perfect god""),
and royal authority (cartouche, seated king with scepter) for the king, and provides a private owner with his patronage and protection.

"name: Ancient Art Scarab of Ramesses II,Egyptian"
Description: The ancient Egyptians believed that the dung beetle, the Scarabaeus sacer, was one of the manifestations of the sun god.
Representations of these beetles were used as amulets, and for ritual or administrative purposes. The scarab displays a ritual scene on its
bottom, which shows the standing figure of King Ramesses II in front of the god Thoth. The king wears the so-called ""Blue Crown"" with
Uraeus-serpent and crown sash, as well as a long elaborate, pleated dress. He presents a squatting figure of the goddess Maat with his
right hand, while his left hand is raised in an adoration gesture towards the god. Thoth, the god of wisdom, is depicted as a squatting
baboon with the hands upon his knees, and moon disk combined with crescent above his head. Above both figures appears an
inscription, containing Ramesses' royal throne name without a cartouche. Below both figures is a large mr-sign, which functions as base
for both figures. The nb-sign in the lower round is not only a filler character, but also creates a balance to the inscription in the upper
round. The layout of the figures and hieroglyphs is balanced, only the moon-ensemble and the sun disk are somewhat deformed and
collide with the borderline. The figure of Ramesses II is very slim in comparison to the compact figure of the baboon-shaped god. The
moon crescent and disk are not attached to the deity and have the same distance to the head of the god as the sun disk does to the head
of the king. The pleated dress of the king and the mane of the baboon have hatch lines, the mantel of the baboon has a crossed-line
pattern. The highest point of the scarab's back is the pronotum (dorsal plate of the prothorax). Pronotum and elytron (wing cases) show
dark blue glazed borderlines, single separation lines, and V-shaped marks for humeral callosities (shoulder thickenings). Small side-
depressions are visible below the pronotum. The semicircular head is flanked by triangular eyes. The side plates are irregularly
trapezoidal and have curved outer edges, and the clypeus (frontal plate) is four times serrated. The proportions of the top are well
balanced. The raised extremities are slender and have natural form, with vertical hatch lines on the upper sides for the tibial teeth and
pilosity (hair). The background between the legs is deeply hollowed out. The base is long-oval, and the drill-hole openings framed. The
scarab is longitudinally pierced, was originally mounted or threaded, and functioned as an amulet. The presentation of the Maat-figure by
Ramesses II to Thoth is part of the ritual, in which the king states to follow and strengthen the ethical rules. This version of the motif has a
second level of meaning: Thoth appears in his moon-god function, and the king, with the sun disk above his head, as representative of
the sun god, father and creator of Maat (principle of justice, truth, and order). They meet to strengthen Maat in this and the other world,
and the throne name of the king can be read in two directions, and interpreted as: ""Strong is the Maat of Re"", but also as ""Strong is the
Maat of Thoth"". Therefore, it is likely that the scarab was made for a funeral context, either for the burial of the king himself, or for a
private person, who trusted in the divine, Maat-guaranteeing power of the king.



"name: Ancient Art Juvenile God with a Sun Disk,Egyptian"
Description: Each morning, the sun was reborn into the world, often in the form of a young child like the one represented in this pendant. Here, the sun
child wears an elaborate necklace and sun disk with a protective uraeus snake on his head. On the right side of his head, he wears a
braided ponytail (part of which is now missing). This ""side-lock of youth"" was a common hairstyle for children in ancient Egypt.

Description: This head of a priest is carved in the round. He has a shaved head that is round on top. There is a stele broken from his back.



"name: Ancient Art Scarab Amulet,Egyptian"
Description: The ancient Egyptians believed that the dung beetle, the Scarabaeus sacer, was one of the manifestations of the sun god.
Representations of these beetles were used as amulets, and for ritual or administrative purposes. The bottom of this scarab displays a
motif that combines the figure of a jackal with nine captives. The reclining jackal's head is raised, and his tail hanging down. Below his
body are nine prisoners in three rows depicted; they are kneeling on the ground with their arms fettered behind their backs. The jackal is
the dominant icon in the composition according to his size and superior position. The slim figures of the prisoners are not intended to
represent individual persons, but a group; all have the same posture and are placed in a symmetrical order; only the position of the
fettered arms shows minor variations. An oval line frames the motif. The highest point of the back is the pronotum (dorsal plate of the
prothorax). Pronotum and elytron (wing cases) have incised borderlines, a double, curved partition line, and one division line between the
wing cases with a scutellum (small central triangle) at the upper end. The semicircular head is flanked by quarter-ovoid eyes; the side
plates are quarter-circular, and the clypeus (front plate) has two central base notches. The raised extremities have natural form, as well as
diagonal (hindlegs) and vertical (frontlegs) hatch notches on the upper sides for tibial teeth and pilosity (hair). The proportions of the top
are slightly unbalanced, the elytron short, and the clypeus and plates very large in comparison to the small head. The base has a
symmetrical long-oval shape. The scarab is longitudinally pierced, was originally mounted or threaded, and used as an institutional,
funerary amulet. The motif on the bottom represents the administrative seal of the Thebes' necropolis, but was also used in other
cemeteries. Nevertheless, the faience material makes it doubtful that the scarab was really used as an official seal. It seems more likely
that the scarab was used as a protective funerary amulet that should guarantee the security of the tomb in this world, and be effective
against dangers in the afterlife. This seal was used since the late 18th Dynasty; comparable seal impressions were found e.g. in the tomb
of king Tutankhamen, and a seal matrix made of faience is today in the Myers Museum at the Eton College.



"name: Ancient Art Nile Catfish Pendant,Egyptian"
Description: This fish pendant represents a Synodontis Batensoda, more commonly known as the Nile catfish, a species of fish named for its black
belly. Often worn at the end of a plait of hair, amulets like this one were used by children and young women to protect against drowning.
This fine amulet is made of gold with stone inlays, including a red stone for the right eye and a green stone for the left. Amulets in the
form of the Synodontis Batensoda were particularly popular during the Middle Kingdom, when the fish might have been identified with an
astronomical constellation.



"name: Ancient Art Scarab with the Cartouche of Thutmose III,Egyptian"
Description: This steatite scarab was originally glazed. It has a flat underside and an inscription on the bottom, a medium high back with thick and
regular incised details. The workmanship is good and the piece is carefully made. This piece served as an individualized amulet and was
originally mounted or threaded. The amulet should secure royal authority for this king (Thutmosis III), and for a private owner his royal
patronage.



"name: Ancient Art Kneeling Heh on a Basket,Egyptian,,Ancient Art Faience Bowl,Egyptian"
Description: This faience bowl has been restored from several fragments. Parts of the bowl have been reconstructed. The entire surface was covered
in a bright turquoise blue glaze and the motifs were painted in a dark violet manganese. The circular foot of the bowl was completely
covered in manganese and formed the center of an open blue lotus flower, the petals and sepals of the flower are outlined and filled with
a series of dashed lines. Just below the rim is an undulating, wave-like border. The rim was covered with a thick stripe of manganese. The
inner surface is painted with a more complex, yet symmetrical design. With the exception of a few details the designs are painted in
outline only and where necessary for definition a series of dashed lines were added. The central motif is a pool composed of four
concentric squares, in which four tilapia fish swim clasping the stems of lotus buds in their mouths. Flowering lotus plants grow outward
from the corners of the pool to the rim of the bowl dividing the remaining space into four zones. There are two sets of mirrored motifs.
One set of motifs includes a tilapia fish swimming with a lotus stem in its mouth and a bunch of tied reeds. The other set of motifs consists
of a lilly-like plant with curling leaves and a leaping gazelle whose head is delicately turned back over its shoulder so that its muzzle
touches the top of the plant. Beneath the front legs of the gazelle is another swimming tilapia fish with a lotus. Both the lotus and the
tilapia were symbolic of renewal and rebirth.



"name: Ancient Art Stylized Scarab with Cartouche of Thutmosis IV (1397-1388 BC),Egyptian"
Description: This steatite scarab has a flat underside with an inscription on the bottom carved in sunk relief technique. The piece was originally glazed.
The top of the scarab is decorated with deep and thick incised details. The workmanship of this piece is good. This piece originally
functioned as an individualized amulet and was once mounted or threaded. The amulet should secure the royal authority for this king,
Thutmosis IV (1397-1388 BC), by his close relation to the god Amun; it should provide a private owner with this king's royal patronage.
The royal epithet ""Image of Amun"" is very popular on scarabs of the New Kingdom.



"name: Ancient Art Bust of a Ram-Headed God (Khnum),Egyptian"

"name: Ancient Art Falcon Reliquary,Egyptian"
Description: This statuette, likely dedicated to the falcon-god Horus, is missing its crown and eye inlays. The structure of the feathers is carefully
incised. The base is inscribed with texts of adoration and prayer. Examination through the hole in the head revealed bird bones that had
been wrapped in linen and placed inside through a trap door between the statuette's legs. A neutron-induced radiograph also reveals the
presence of bones inside the reliquary.



"name: Ancient Art Finger Ring with Names of Amun-Re in a Cartouche,Egyptian"
Description: This type of cartouche-shaped signet ring with a very long bezel made of faience was popular from the late 20th to the 23rd Dynasties. A
question exists as to whether these rings were ever actually used as signets or were for funerary purposes, religious souvenirs, or gifts for
special occasions. It seems probable that rings with blank bezels were mass-made in molds and that, while the material was soft before
firing, the inscription was added. This small version is made of blue faience. Incrustations exist in the shallow crudely carved hieroglyphs
which read ""Men-ib-re, right of voice, the great god,"" a fictitious name which is attested elsewhere.

",Ancient Art "Scarab with ""Udjat"" Eyes"name: Egyptian"
Description: This steatite scarab is the bezel of a finger ring. Its flat underside is incised with a vertically arranged design of a pair of facing, connected
""Udjat"" eyes with script signs below. The design of the back of the scarab is simple with short and aligned carved side-notches and a
well proportioned layout. The workmanship of the piece is slightly rough and it is not very carefully made. This scarab originally functioned
as an amulet. It should protect the life and regeneration of its owner and provide divine support. The piece was originally mounted or
threaded. The very stylized shape of ""Udjat""-eye-pair was common in the late Middle Kingdom and the Second Intermediate Period.



"name: Ancient Art Naturalistic Scarab,Egyptian"
Description: Naturalistic scarabs, which exhibit a beetle-formed underside instead of a flat bottom with additional motifs, became popular in the late
Third Intermediate and Late periods. They were attached to the mummy bandages and were part of the amulet set. There are two
varieties of such scarabs: red carnelian and blue-green faience scarabs. It is likely that the blue-green scarabs focus only on the renewal
aspect, while the red carnelian scarabs were related to the sun rise/set aspect and gave special protection at the critical transition phase.



"name: Ancient Art Male Figure Standing,Egyptian"
Description: This sculpture is carved in the round and painted. It depicts a nude male with black hair and black and white painted eyes. His arms are

"name: Islamic Art Standing Thoth with Ibis Head,Egyptian"
Description: The Egyptians depicted Thoth, the god of wisdom and writing, as an ibis (a wading bird), a man with an ibis head, or a baboon. Thoth
amulets primarily protected officials and the deceased in the underworld. This was probably made during the 30th Dynasty.



"name: Ancient Art Scarab with Wish Formula,Egyptian"
Description: This obsidian scarab is inscribed on the flat underside with vertically arranged column writing requesting the support of the royal palace.
The top of the scarab is incised with a detailed design with thick lines, slightly irregular line flow and almost balanced proportions. The
piece is simply made and the workmanship is slightly rough. The scarab functioned as a provider individualized amulet with a wish
formula. The amulet should provide its owner with the protection of Horus. The piece was originally mounted or threaded. A similar wish
formula can be found on Walters 42.8.



"name: Ancient Art Bes,Egyptian"
Description: This dwarf-like, protective deity was very popular in ancient Egypt. Bes is represented with the nude body of a dwarf, grotesque facial
features, and the ears and mane of a lion. He wears a tall feather-crown and usually rests his hands on his hips. Known from as early as
the Middle Kingdom (ca. 2000 BCE), Bes was venerated as a protector of the home, family, and childbirth, and for that reason figures
prominently in domestic magic and amulets. His close connection to all aspects of fertility and sexuality is demonstrated by the presence
of his image in the ""Birth-houses""-shrines associated with temples of the Late Period and Ptolemaic period. He also had a special
relation to the goddess Hathor and performed in her retinue as a musician and dancer. This amulet-pendant presents the god in a
standing posture. The stocky figure is compact and dominated by the massive feather crown. Dark blue markings show the structure of
the feathers and highlight the armlets and bracelets worn by the god. The amulet has a rectangular base and a loop on the back.

Description: This tile is an example of Sultanabad ware and features two wrestlers. Sultanabad ware is a special type of underglazed, painted ceramic,

represents Sufi exercises.



",Islamic Art "Amuletic Figure of Hapy, Son of Horus"name: Egyptian"
Description: This faience amulet represents Hapy, the baboon-headed son of Horus. There are four sons of Horus and this amulet is part of a set of
four (Walters 48.1638-1641). The sons of Horus protected he vital organs of the body after mummification. The image is that of a baboon-
headed mummiform human. The figure faces proper right. It is composed of blue glazed faience with the details picked out in purple/black
manganese. The figure wears a tripartite wig, but unlike the other three in this set he does not wear a broad collar. There are five diagonal
stripes of manganese across the mummiform body representing the mummy wrappings or braces. A horizontal fracture at knee level
separated the amulet into two fragments which have since been reattached. Numerous funerary amulets were usually placed among the
many layers of linen strips used to wrap mummies. Specific amulets, along with their required position on the body, are listed in funerary
texts such as ""The Book of the Dead."" Amulets were sometimes sewn directly onto the wrappings or could be incorporated into a bead
net shroud covering the mummy. These amulets have been modeled with a flat underside and are pierced by tiny holes around the edges
for attachment.



"name: Ancient Art Unfinished Statue of a Man,Egyptian"
Description: The top of a wrap-around garment is seen on this unfinished work. It may have been intended as a royal statue, then altered for a private
owner, which would explain the chiseled area on the forehead where the uraeus serpent, a symbol of royalty, may have been.

relation to the goddess Hathor and performed in her retinue as a musician and dancer. This amulet of Bes is a variant of the standard
type, representing the god with a protruding tongue and with uraei (cobra serpents), crowned by sun-disks which flank his feathered
crown. A rectangular base and a loop behind the head complete the pendant.

"name: Ancient Art Amulet-Pendant of Nephthys,Egyptian"
Description: While Egyptian jewelry was worn in daily life, most of the examples known today came from tombs, where they adorned mummies.
Amulets provided magical protection for the wearer in both life and death. The consistent color and workmanship of the 13 light-blue
faience figures of gods owned by the Walters (this one and Walters 48.1676, 48.1677, 48.1679, 48.1680, 48.1684, 48.1701, 48.1702,
48.1704, 48.1708, 48.1709, 48.1710 and 48.1711) suggest that they came from the same workshop. Represented here is the goddess
Nephthys.



"name: Ancient Art Nes-Ptah Holding Shrine with Osiris,Egyptian"
Description: This piece is sculpted in the round and has an inscription around the pedestal, on b oth sides of the shrine, over the shrine entrance, to
the left side of the rear column and on the rear of the rear column.



",Ancient Art "Sword (""Kilij"")"name: Islamic,,Islamic Art Box with Lid,Egyptian"
Description: This unusual container, in the form of a miniature shrine or shrine-shaped sarcophagus, was made for an important official, the treasurer
and steward Neter-isy, and his wife Nub-em-seshy. Since the lid is inscribed with an offering text and Neter-isy is called ""the justified,""
meaning deceased (on the right side of the box), the container was probably a funerary object included in the couple's tomb.



"name: Ancient Art Male Figure Standing,Egyptian"
Description: This sculpture is carved in the round and painted. The man wears a long skirt that is flat at the front. His right arm is joined at the
shoulder, and his right hand is clenched with an opening. His left arm is in piece with the body; his left hand is open. The paint is largely
gone. This is a workshop piece.



",Ancient Art "Figure of Duamutef, Son of Horus"name: Egyptian"
Description: During the process of mummification, amulets of different kinds were placed on the body or wrapped in the mummy bindings to protect
the deceased from the dangers of the underworld. Figures of the four ""Sons of Horus,"" the gods who protected the containers that held
the organs of the deceased, were an indispensable part of a complete set of amulets. This figure of the jackal-headed god Duamutef, who
was responsible for the stomach, is formed in the round and has a backplate and base. The mummiform god wears a long wig and holds
a long folded cloth in each hand.



"name: Ancient Art Ptah Seated on Throne,Egyptian"
Description: This small statuette shows the god Ptah wearing a royal kilt, bead collar, bracelets and armlets. He is seated on a throne formed by
walking lions. The relief on the right and left sides of the thrown show a rampant lion seizing a kneeling enemy, and at the back with
hanging lotus stalks. Behind Ptah, Isis is shown in relief seated on a djed-column with outspread wings protecting the god. Fragmentary
text on the bottom of the base includes the name and epithets of Ptah.



"name: Ancient Art Ostracon with a Royal Head,Egyptian"
Description: This sketch depicts a king wearing the ""blue crown,"" a collar, and two strings of gold beads. His stubble beard is a sign of mourning. The
features of the king make it likely that Seti I is represented. The elaborate execution of the royal image, which is without doubt the work of
a master painter, differs from the depiction of the two hands. This sketch was probably a model for trainees, and was later reused for
other training purposes by an experienced artist. It is interesting that the painter of the royal head has chosen the topic of a stubble-
bearded king, which was not part of the official motifs.



"name: Ancient Art Kneeling King,Egyptian"
Description: One of the main duties of the Egyptian king was to perform rituals for the gods. There are many representations which show him either
standing or kneeling with offerings in his hands, or in a gesture of adoration. This kneeling king is dressed in the royal Nemes headdress,
a royal kilt, and an elaborate collar. The figure has lost the inserted cobra serpent above the forehead, the arms, and the offerings in his
hands.



"name: Ancient Art Vase in the Shape of a Duck,Egyptian"
Description: Egyptian faience is a composite material composed of ground quartz and natron (sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate). Most
faience is glazed in a vivid blue or green color; the polychrome faience seen here is much more complicated to produce. During the 26th
Dynasty, the Greeks established merchant colonies in Egypt. Faience workshops in these towns produced goods for the local population,
as well as products in an Egyptian style for export. The duck was mold-made together with the remains of its ring handle on the bird's left
side. The surface of the body displays a raised dot pattern, while the end of the wings have a feather pattern. The form may have been
inspired by the red-figure duck vases of Etruria and south Italy. The duck is depicted with such detailed naturalism that the underside
even has delicately modeled webbed feet.



"name: Ancient Art Offering Table,Egyptian"
Description: This table is carved in relief and has a spout at the back. Customary offerings of food and drink cover the whole table except the rim; in
the center are a goose and a bowl, while on the left and right are two round loaves and a tall water pot.



"name: Ancient Art Pectoral with Solar Boat,Egyptian"
Description: This steatite plaque was used as a small pectoral. The front is carved in relief depicting the solar boat with two standing baboons in
worshipping gesture flanking the winged scarab as well as the moon crescent and disk combination. Incised on the back is a scene in
which the god Re-Harakhte is seated as falcon-headed deity and as a solar falcon on the left and including the center; opposite of them is
Atum, the creator god.



"name: Ancient Art Scarab,Egyptian"
Description: This serpentine scarab has a flat underside without a bottom design. The design of the back is very detailed, with fine incised lines and
regular line flow. The proportions of the top are almost balanced, the workmanship of the piece is excellent, and it is elaborately made.
This scarab functioned as a funerary amulet with renewal connotations. It was probably an inlay or the central piece of a winged scarab.


"name: Ancient Art Scarab with Three Columns of Pseudo-hieroglyphs,Egyptian"
Description: The ancient Egyptians believed that the dung beetle, the Scarabaeus sacer, was one of the manifestations of the sun god.
Representations of these beetles were used as amulets, and for ritual or administrative purposes. This scarab has a special motif on the
bottom, which is known as a-n-r-combination, because it consists of the sound-signs for 'ayn, n, and r. The signs are arranged in three
columns, combined with lotus blossoms at the beginnings and ends; the columns are framed by an oval line. The bottom design is deeply
incised, and the shape of the signs typical for the Second Intermediate Period: n with a horizontal line crossed by short vertical lines, c
with a curved line, and an oval lop at the end. The highest point of the back is the elytron (wing cases); two side-notches at shoulder
height define the partition between pronotum (dorsal plate of the prothorax) and elytron. The head is trapezoidal, and the clypeus has four
frontal serrations and a central base notch. The design of the back is simple, the carved side-notches short and not totally aligned. The
proportions are unbalanced, and the pronotum is short in comparison to the head section and the elytron. The raised extremities have
natural form and vertical hatch lines; the background between the legs is hollowed out. The base is long-oval, and the head part smaller
than the rear part. The scarab is longitudinally pierced, was originally mounted or threaded, and served as an amulet. Probably, it should
grant magical and/or divine support (a-n-r-pattern) and regeneration (lotus). It is not possible to determine the exact meaning of the a-n-r-
pattern, although several options, such as a relation to the name of the god Re, or to a magical formula, have been discussed. In this
special case with the dominance of c and n, it would make sense to consider a magical formula, which should strengthen the recreative
(scarab), and regenerative (lotus) function by repetition.



"name: Ancient Art Wall Fragment with a Head to the Left,Egyptian"
Description: This wall fragment is carved in sunk relief and depicts a head facing left. There is a frieze above the head.



"name: Ancient Art Seal Ring with Name of Tutankhamun,Egyptian"
Description: This piece is a flimsily constructed pale turquoise-colored faience ring. The throne name of King Tutankhamun (Menkheperre) is
impressed on the bezel.



"name: Ancient Art Scarab with Two Different Images of Thoth,Egyptian"
Description: This steatite scarab has a flat underside with a horizontally arranged design of two different images of a god, Thoth. The first figure has a
human body and ibis head, and the second is baboon-shaped with hands on the knees and tail raised in back. The top design is detailed.
The piece is poorly made and the workmanship is rough. The piece functioned as an individualized provider amulet, and was originally
mounted or threaded. The amulet should secure the support of Thoth. It is possible that it had a funerary function, and that Thoth is
depicted in two moon god manifestations, although no moon disk is depicted above the head of one of the figures. In this case, the piece
would stand for renewal. The combination of two different representations of Thoth is uncommon.



",Ancient Art "King with the Blue Crown and ""Was"" Scepter"name: Egyptian"
Description: This fragmentary sculptor's model depicts a king, facing right, and holding a ""was""-scepter. He wears a Blue Crown with uraeus and a
broad collar.



"name: Ancient Art Base with Two Prostrate Figures,Egyptian"
Description: Two provincial governors are shown prostrate before a higher authority. A third governor was once between them, but both his figure and
his name have been removed. This unique sculpture must have been combined with the statue of a god or king. It is possible that the
work was once part of a larger group that may have shown all the provincial governors of Upper and Lower Egypt. The removal of the
middle figure may either have been a ""damnatio memoriae"" to destroy the commemoration of the depicted person, or to replace his
image by the figure of another person.



"name: Ancient Art Horus with Falcon's Head,Egyptian"
Description: This pendant shows falcon-headed Horus seated on a rectangular base. A loop for suspension projects from the back, and there is a
rectangular tenon on the head.



"name: Ancient Art Neck Amphora with Tendril Decoration,Egyptian"
Description: Relief decoration of lattice and scrolls, with a darker blue glaze. At base of handles, human faces. On lip, circles and points with
background of darker blue.


"name: Ancient Art Amphora with Cover,Egyptian"
Description: A rare and fine example of so-called ""Egyptian blue"" ceramic ware, this lovely vase has a form similar to contemporary vessels of
alabaster.



"name: Ancient Art Shu,Egyptian"
Description: While Egyptian jewelry was worn in daily life, most of the examples known today came from tombs, where they adorned mummies.
Amulets provided magical protection for the wearer in both life and death. The consistent color and workmanship of the 13 light-blue
faience figures of gods owned by the Walters (this one and Walters 48.1676, 48.1677, 48.1679, 48.1680, 48.1701, 48.1702, 48.1704,
48.1705, 48.1708, 48.1709, 48.1710 and 48.1711) suggest that they came from the same workshop. Represented here is the god Shu
with raised arms.



"name: Ancient Art Head of a Man,Egyptian"
Description: This head is carved in the round. It is broken off below the neck. The man's hair is in rows of rectangles. His ears are carved.



"name: Ancient Art Scarab with Bound Captive,Egyptian"
Description: This light beige steatite scarab was originally glazed blue or green. The piece is inscribed on the flat underside with an image of a captive
Libyan and a short column of hieroglyphics. The top of the piece is high with a detailed incised design. The workmanship is good and the
piece is carefully made. This scarab functioned as a protective amulet and had royal connotations. It was originally mounted or threaded.
The bottom motif refers to the royal control over all foreign countries and should ward off all dangers for its owner. It is imaginable that
soldiers on an expedition or at the frontier used such amulets. The image of a fettered captive is a popular motif on scarabs, however, the
figure of a captive is usually subordinate to the figure of a king. In this case, there is no representation of the king, only the short
inscription, which refers to him. It is possible that such an amulet should provide magical protection for Egyptians traveling abroad or for
Egyptian allies. The very round base and the style of the carvings are typical for the early 18th Dynasty.



"name: Ancient Art A Worshipper Kneeling Before the God Anubis,Egyptian"
Description: A bronze statuette of the anthropomorphic god Anubis facing a kneeling worshiper. He has the head of a jackal and the body of a human
male. The piece has been cast in three sections and then joined. The eyes of Anubis are inlaid with gold and there are traces of gilding
on the shoulders, wrists, ankles, neck, wig, and ears. The gilding was delicately applied to the eyes, eyebrows and muzzle, but in other
areas it appears to have been applied in a more careless fashion. The piece is well preserved in general but there is a break on the lower
back corner of the base and there is some green and bright blue corrosion on the lower side of the base. A hieroglyphic inscription runs
around the main base, the base of the Anubis figure and along the back pillar of the worshiper, identifying the dedicant as one Wdja-Hor-
resnet, son of Ankh-pa-khered, who is asking for the blessings of the god Anubis. The figure of Anubis is in a striding position with his
proper left leg advanced. His proper right arm hangs at his side and the right hand is clenched into a fist with the thumb protruding. The
proper left arm is raised and bent at the elbow and there is a drilled hole in the hand for the insertion of an object. Earlier photographs of
this piece in Darresy's ""Statues de DivinitÃ©s,"" show that the missing object was a ""was"" scepter. He wears a tripartite wig, ""shendyt""
kilt with deep pleats and a striated belt. A broad collar, armlets and bracelets are incised and gilded. Anklets are suggested by the gilding
around the ankles but they are not incised. The musculature of the limbs and the torso is clearly defined. The ears of the god are large
and the inner detailing has been carefully modeled. The muzzle comes to a delicate point, accentuating the skillfully modeled eyes,
sweeping brows, nose and mouth. There are two cobras at the feet of the deity facing the worshipper. The proper right cobra wears the
Red Crown of Lower Egypt and the left cobra wears the White Crown of Upper Egypt. The head of the left cobra is raised slightly higher
than that of the right. A worshipper kneels before the god with his back against an inscribed pillar which is pyramidal at the top. He kneels
with both knees down on a flat rectangular base, which is attached to the larger main base below. He extends his hands to the god palms
down. He wears a ""shendyt"" kilt, but the pleats are not carved with the same precision that is seen on the kilt of the god. The bent knees
are squared off unnaturally and the legs blend together below the kilt. He has an inscribed broad collar. He also wears a skull cap, the
front line of which is clearly marked across his brow. The face is round with full cheeks and no definition of the chin. The ears are large
and set high. The eyes are natural and do not have cosmetic brows. The nose is straight and the mouth is small with slightly pursed lips.
The overall surface of the worshipper is pitted whereas the figure of Anubis has a high polish.



"name: Ancient Art Inlay of Horus the Child,Egyptian,,Ancient Art Inlay of a Falcon,Egyptian"
Description: This is a representation of a falcon and was probably used as an inlay.



"name: Ancient Art Thoth-Baboon,Egyptian"
Description: The patron of scribes and deity of wisdom, Thoth was associated with the sun and the moon, traditionally the two ""eyes"" of the celestial-
god Horus. The baboon, identified with Thoth, here holds a sacred Wedjat-eye, the so-called Eye of Horus, which symbolizes legitimate
kingship, the structured universe, and life. This carefully formed baboon holds the eye in front of his chest with his left hand below and the
right above.


"name: Ancient Art Heart Scarab of Bak-en-Djehuti,Egyptian"
Description: The ancient Egyptians believed that the dung beetle, the Scarabaeus sacer, was one of the manifestations of the sun god.
Representations of these beetles were used as amulets, and for ritual or administrative purposes. This scarab is a so-called Heart scarab
which was used for the deceased. The linearly incised bottom inscription contains spell 30 B of the Book of the Dead. The left reading text
is displayed in ten lines, separated by nine, very straight text-divider, and framed by an oval line. The hieroglyphs are less detailed and
slightly irregular. The layout is well organized, and the signs evenly spaced. The back of the scarab is very high, and the highest point at
the partition between pronotum (dorsal plate of the prothorax) and elytron (wing cases). Both parts have incised borderlines, a slightly
curved double partition lines, and a triple division line between the wing cases. The rectangular head is flanked by quarter-spherical, two-
stage eyes with lid markings. The side plates and the clypeus (front plate) are trapezoidal. On the left wing case is an inscription with
name and title of the owner: ""the priest of Amun: Bak-en-Djehuti,"" and on the right wing case a crossed lines pattern and a formula
wishing him life. The style of the inscription on the back differs from that on the bottom, and it is most likely that the text on the back with
the individualization was added later by another hand. The crossed lines on the right wing case are less deeply incised, and might have
been added later, only the ankh-sign (meaning ""life"") looks similar to the inscription on the left wing case. The extremities have natural
form, and vertical and diagonal hatch lines for the tibial teeth and the pilosity (hair). The low, oval base is slightly asymmetrical and has a
smaller head. The scarab was produced to be placed in the wrappings of a mummy. It was individualized by his name of the deceased:
Bak-en-Djehuti. Such funerary amulet should cause the renewal of the deceased, and support him in the Weighing of the Heart procedure
in the Judgement hall of the underworld.



"name: Ancient Art Turban Helmet,Islamic"
Description: A warrior would have worn this helmet over a cloth turban. He would have been confident of being safeguarded in battle by the writing
around the helmet's rim. The inscription from the Qur'an is garbled, however, indicating that its Iranian maker may not have known Arabic.
Yet the presence of Arabic writing apparently was thought to be enough to invoke the protective power of God's word. This helmet once
belonged to the royal arsenal in Istanbul, Turkey. It was probably part of the war booty amassed by the Ottoman Dynasty during the many
wars between Turkey and Iran. Later, it was owned by the French painter Jean-LÃ©on GÃ©rÃ´me, who traveled throughout the Near East
and painted many scenes of Muslim life.



"name: Islamic Art Fragment of a Uraeus with the Head of a King,Egyptian"

"name: Ancient Art Block Statue of Sheshonq (Shishak),Egyptian"
Description: This squatting figure has his knees drawn up and his arms crossed on his knees. He wears a wig. On the front is the deceased

"name: Ancient Art Ushabti,Egyptian"
Description: This carved and painted ushabti figure has long hair, necklaces, crossed arms and no tools. The tools may have originally been painted
on. There is an inscription on the front of the skirt.



"name: Ancient Art Fragment of a Tomb Relief,Egyptian"
Description: This block, carved in low raised relief, depicts the upper portion of a male figure facing right. The royal scribe Nahu, brother of King
Tutankhamen's treasurer Maya, is depicted wearing the elaborate court attire of the late New Kingdom. He wears a short coiffure of small
braids that cover the ears, a pleated loincloth, a thin, pleated vest with short sleeves, and a double necklace, probably the esteemed Gold
of Honor. In his raised right hand he holds a water jug, while in the left, which is stretched downwards, he holds an incense burner. The
inscription, carved in sunk relief on a raised area in front of the man's face, identifies him as Nahu-(her), the brother of Maya, whose tomb
at Saqqara this relief originally came from. This relief shows him making an offering in honor of his brother. The surface of this piece is
damaged, with chips, some chisel marks, and cracks in the surface. In some areas of the limestone, the matrix with chips looks very
granular, yellowish-brown in color and resembling sandstone, though overall the surface is grayish in color. The libation vessel in his right
hand is still nearly complete, but only about half of the incense burner he holds in his left hand is preserved on the slab. A correction was
made to the incense burner held in the right hand during ancient times. There are traces of blue and other colors of pigments on the
piece.



"name: Ancient Art Commemorative Scarab of Amenhotep III,Egyptian"
Description: The ancient Egyptians believed that the dung beetle, the Scarabaeus sacer, was one of the manifestations of the sun god.
Representations of these beetles were used as amulets, and for ritual or administrative purposes. This scarab belongs to the so-called
group of Commemorative scarabs, which were produced in the first years of the reign of king Amenhotep III and his wife Tiye. The bottom
inscription of the scarab shows ten lines with left reading hieroglyphs, nine horizontal text dividers, and an oval frame. The inscription
contains the so-called ""marriage text."" It focuses on the divine power and royal authority of the king, the legitimate royal status of the
queen, as well as the royal sphere of control in Egypt and the foreign countries. The is precisely written, the shapes of the signs simple
and clear, and executed with thick lines; the layout is well organized, but the signs are more narrowly spaced in the upper lines than in
the lower ones, indicating that the scribe had to stretch the text to the end. The highest point of the back is the pronotum (dorsal plate of
the prothorax). Pronotum and elytron (wing cases) have single borderlines, a double line between the wing cases, and V-shaped marks
for the humeral callosities (shoulder thickenings). The semicircular head has a double borderline, and a short zigzag line at the bottom,
and the eyes are not marked. The side plates are irregularly trapezoidal, and the clypeus (front plate) shows four frontal serrations. The
proportions of the top are slightly unbalanced, and the head sections short in comparison to the large pronotum. The raised, slender
extremities have natural form, and vertical hatch notches at the forelegs for the tibial teeth. The low oval base is symmetrical. The scarab
is longitudinally pierced and was mounted or threaded. The so-called Commemorative scarabs of Amenhotep III were part of a program
of official gifts established in the first eleven years of his reign. The texts on the bottom of the large size scarabs glorify the king and
queen Tiye, and focus on special events. There are five different types (referring to bull hunt, lion hunt, sphere of control, creation of an
artificial lake = realization of Maat, and diplomatic relations to the Mitanni = success foreign policy), which were produced in the 2nd, 10th
and 11th year of the reign of the king. All of them mention beside Amenhotep III also his wife Tiye. The scarabs were most probably
distributed to high officials or special offices in Egypt and abroad. This scarab celebrates the divine and royal power of the king, his
authority and sphere of control, as well as the royal status of his wife Tiye. The form of scarab elucidates that such a gift had not only a
political, but also an amuletic function. It refers to the stability of royal power by continuous renewal, and so far to the reliability of royal
patronage for the donee or his office. More than 200 examples of these scarabs have been preserved, and alone 64 belong to the
""sphere of control"" category. The astonishing amount of preserved scarabs refers to the enormous output figures, and their special
importance.

"name: Ancient Art Large Amuletic Bead,Egyptian"
Description: In addition to its original function as a personal seal, the scarab became one of the most powerful amulets, used by the living and
entombed with the dead. Countless variations have been preserved, differing in design, size, and material, but always associated with
eternity and regeneration. Some special scarabs have human or ram heads (the emblem of the god Amen-Re) joined to the body of the
beetle. Others, called scaraboids, have the body replaced with that of another animal but retain the general oval shape. Rarer items are
decorated beads, which were part of precious necklaces. Some show a palm tree surrounded by monkeys, symbolizing the daily rising of
the sun god.



"name: Ancient Art Scarab with Private Name Seal,Egyptian,,Ancient Art Model of a Male Face,Egyptian"

"name: Islamic Art Scarab with the Cartouche of Thutmosis III,Egyptian"
Description: The ancient Egyptians believed that the dung beetle, the Scarabaeus sacer, was one of the manifestations of the sun god.
Representations of these beetles were used as amulets, and for ritual or administrative purposes. This scarab has a bottom inscription,
which consists of three columns, framed by an oval line; the central column has a royal cartouche. The text contains the name, titles, and
epithets of King Thutmose III. The inscription is carved in sunken relief. The layout is arranged to fit in the oval frame, but the two outer
columns are not well balanced, and some signs collide with the borderline. The shape of the hieroglyphs is slightly rough, and the nfr-sign
has three instead of two horizontal lines. The highest point of the back is partition between pronotum (dorsal plate of the prothorax) and
elytron (wing cases). Pronotum and elytron display incised borderlines, single separation lines, and V-shaped marks for the humeral
callosities (thickenings at the shoulders). The borderlines of the elytron ends at the rear in half spirals. The proportions of the top are
unbalanced, the pronotum and head section are short in comparison to the elytron. The head has long-oval shape, the side plates are
irregularly trapezoidal, and clypeus (front plate) shows a central base notch. The carved extremities show natural form, and vertical hatch
lines on the upper sides for the tibial teeth and pilosity (hair). The symmetrical base has a long-oval shape; and the drill-holes of the
scarab are framed. The scarab is longitudinally pierced, was originally mounted or threaded, and functions as an amulet. This amulet
should ensure for its owner support by the royal authority (cartouche) of the divine king (title: ""Perfect God""), and all-inclusive protection
(epithet: ""who reverses the foreign countries"".) The scarab was produced after the death of King Thutmose III, who was most probably
understood as a protective god and successful model of divine kingship. The change of the royal title nb t3.wj ""Lord of the Two Lands"" to
nb t3.w ""Lord of the Lands"" may be either a writing mistake, or a variant to make the title match to the plural form in the epithet formula
""all foreign countries."" The esthetical balance of the signs (four horizontal signs at each side of the cartouche) may have played a role
also.



"name: Ancient Art Temple Relief Fragment of Ptolemy II Offering to Osiris and Another God,Egyptian"
Description: Ptolemy II presents offerings to the enthroned god Osiris in two scenes. To the left, the king holds an object composed of hieroglyphs
meaning ""all life and dominion"" before the god's partially preserved figure. To the right, the king wears a headdress composed of double
plumes and offers another hieroglyphic object, this time a figure of the goddess of cosmic order, Maat, meaning that the king rules with
order and justice.



"name: Ancient Art Isis-Fortuna,Egyptian"
Description: From the second half of the first millennium BC the goddess Isis became more and more popular outside Egypt. Particularly during the
Roman period, she was worshipped as a goddess who unites all other goddesses in herself. In the Ptolemaic period Isis received
Hellenistic iconography in addition to her Egyptian iconography. She was the only Egyptian goddess to receive such a second ""outfit.""
The reason, most likely, was her increasing popularity in the Hellenistic and Roman world. This statuette of Isis displays her in a
Hellenistic robe. She has a combination of cow horns, sun-disk, and ears of corn as a crown on her head, a cornucopia in her left arm,
and a ship's rudder in her right hand. The cornucopia connects her to the goddess Fortuna, and the ears of corn to Demeter. The rudder
stresses the aspect of Isis as patron of navigation, called Isis Pelagia. However the most important attribute is the cornucopia, which
because of its size needed an additional support in the form of an extra pillar below the elbow of the goddess.



"name: Ancient Art Imti Standing,Egyptian"
Description: Patrons occasionally commissioned sculptors to show them at a particular time of life. Imti is represented as a youth with close-cropped
hair. A necklace of alternating white and black beads with amulet and a blue bracelet bordered in white and black adorn his otherwise
nude body. Nudity may also suggest rebirth into the afterlife. Typical of wooden statues, the arms and front of the feet were carved
separately and attached to the body or base with pegs. The boy is depicted striding with his left foot forward. His right arm is at his side
and his left arm is bent forward to hold a staff (which is missing). The head is shaven and the hairline and hair tufts are represented by a
black line and black points, respectively. The whole figure is covered with a thin layer of red-brown paint, chipped off in many pieces. The
finger-nails are painted white and two black dots above the buttocks indicate dimples. The base is red with a black top and is incised with
hieroglyphs filled in with white. The inscription on the base names the owner of the statue. The arms are inset and fastened with wooden
nails. The feet are made separately and are fastened to the base with wooden nails.



"name: Ancient Art Anubis Pantistic,Egyptian"
Description: This amulet is the head of a jackal. He holds a whip and crook, and is kneeling with snakes before his knees. He has the tail of a bird.



"name: Ancient Art Plaque with the Throne Name of Thutmosis IV,Egyptian"
Description: This symmetrical oval plaque has icons and inscriptions on both sides. The front depicts an icon and image of King Thutmosis IV (1397-
1388 BCE); on the back is a representation of a vulture combined with the royal name. Both sides are executed in sunk relief with deeply
incised outlines and finer lines on the inner structures. The sides are smoothed and the layout is balanced. The piece is carefully made.
The plaque functioned as an individualized amulet, and was originally mounted and threaded. The amulet should secure the divinity and
royal authority for the king, as well as divine protection; it should provide a private owner with his royal patronage and divine protection.
The figure of the vulture above a cartouche is less common on scarabs; more often are examples displaying the vulture with outstretched
wings at the side of the royal name. Oval plaques of this type are typical for the 18th Dynasty, especially for the period of the reign of
Thutmosis III (1479-1425 BCE)-Amenophis III (1388-1351/1350 BCE).



"name: Ancient Art Iret-horru with Osiris,Egyptian"
Description: In ancient Egypt political upheavals, accompanied by changes in religious practices, were often an occasion for innovations in private
sculpture. This was especially evident in the early 18th Dynasty, when new statue types, representing the donor holding a naos or a
sistrum, among other objects, came into use for the first time. The representation of a donor (depicted standing, seated, kneeling, or
squatting) proffering the figure of a deity or a sacred object ensured the donor's eternal participation in the rituals undertaken in the gods'
presence. Representations of the ritual interaction between men and gods were even more highly sought when the high priests of Amun
seized power in Thebes during in the 21st Dynasty and ruled the country's south. From this point onward, over a period of several
centuries, statues depicting the donor squatting or holding the image of a god were almost the only statue types, dedicated in
extraordinary numbers, in the temple of Amun at Karnak. The vast extent of these dedications was attested early in the 20th century,
when the French architect Georges Legrain discovered a cache of nearly eight hundred stone statues and seventeen thousand bronzes,
as well as other artifacts, buried in the courtyard of the temple of Amun in front of the 7th pylon. The standing figure of the priest Iret-horru
was one of these statues-the largest Egyptian statue hoard ever recorded-ritually buried by temple priests in the Ptolemaic period to
relieve the crowding of more than two thousand years of private offerings. Iret-horru holds the mummified figure of Osiris, the god of the
netherworld, outfitted in his traditional regalia: the tall Atef-crown and crook and flail. The priest himself wears a wide wig with narrow
striations and ankle-length pleated garment with a prominent trapezoidal apron. The frontal view exhibits a prominent collarbone and an
articulated sternum. Despite its awkward proportions (the arms in particular are clumsily rendered), the statue has a majestic appearance.
Statues of donors bearing figures of Osiris were among the most popular types of private statuary in the Late Period; this example was
dedicated to Iret-horru by his son Necho, who also served as a priest in Karnak.



"name: Ancient Art Cat with Kittens,Egyptian"
Description: Representations of cats are well-known in Ancient Egypt from the 2nd millennium BCE. The onomatopoetic Egyptian name was ""miu""
(mjw) for the male, and ""mit"" (mjjt) for the female cat. Egypt's economic base was agriculture and therefore rodent- and snake-hunting
felines were very much appreciated. In terms of religious beliefs the male cat was connected to the sun-god, and the female cat to Bastet.
Particularly in the Late and Greco-Roman Periods representations of the goddess as well as cats and cats with kittens became very
popular to symbolize fertility and renewal. This amulet displays a seated female cat with a kitten in front of her. This kitten is facing the
right and has the same posture as its mother. The amulet has a rectangular base and a loop on the back of the cat.



"name: Ancient Art Ram of Amun-Re,Egyptian"
Description: The figure of the ram with horn and a sun disk is a representation of the god Amun-Re.



"name: Ancient Art Anubis Standing,Egyptian"
Description: Anubis, the god of embalming and protector of the deceased, is depicted with a man's body, a jackal's head, and long wig. The arms and
the tip of the nose were made separately. The figure was likely made for a tomb.



"name: Ancient Art Statue of Taweret,Egyptian"
Description: Ancient Egyptians believed the goddess Taweret, whose name translates as ""the Great One,"" offered protection to women during
pregnancy and childbirth. She is represented as a hippopotamus with a swollen belly, pendulous human breasts, the limbs of a lion, and
the back and tail of a crocodile. Taweret was a benevolent deity and was commonly depicted on amulets. Underscoring her function as a
protector, she holds the hieroglyph ""sa,"" meaning protection, in each hand, (the cartouches on her shoulders were added at a later date,
and have so far escaped a definitive reading). Although her cult gained great importance, she had no temples of her own.



"name: Ancient Art Male Figure Standing,Egyptian"
Description: This granite figure has hair in rectangles and both hands clenched at his sides. He wears a ribbed kilt.



"name: Ancient Art Pantheistic Deity Pendant,Egyptian"
Description: This amulet shows the god Horus with various royal, divine, and animal attributes that enhance its protective power.



"name: Ancient Art Palm Column Kohl Tube,Egyptian"
Description: The Egyptian learned from their Near Eastern neighbors how to make glass. At first they imported the raw material and processed it in
Egypt, but soon they learned how to produce it by themselves. This core-formed glass kohl tube, is datable to the 18th Dynasty. Originally
there would have been a long thin glass applicator for the kohl as well. The palm column shape was quite common for glass kohl tubes.
The body of the vessel is composed of translucent bright turquoise colored glass and the surface polish is in excellent condition. The
flaring palm top is outlined in dark yellow glass and the opening of the vessel is outlined in opaque white glass. The neck of the tube is
decorated with six raised threads of glass. The body is decorated with threads of yellow and white glass which have been dragged to form
a festoon pattern. The bottom of the tube is rounded and has a flared ridge around the edge. Some of the core material is still visible
inside.



"name: Ancient Art Scarab with the Name of Queen Tiye,Egyptian"
Description: This steatite scarab is inscribed on the bottom in partly sunk relief with the name of Queen Tiye. The top is medium high and is shallowly
incised with details of good workmanship. This piece functioned as an individualized amulet, and was originally mounted or threaded.
Scarabs with Tiye's name and title are very well known, and have been found in Egypt and abroad. They should secure Tiye's royal
status, but also guarantee her royal patronage for a private owner of the amulet. Moreover, it is likely that the Egyptians believed that Tiye
had a special relation to the gods, and would function as a mediator. There are many scarabs and plaques with the name of Queen Tiye,
and most of them are not personal seals, but supportive amulets given to honorable people in Egypt and abroad. The impressive amount
of scarabs with Tiye's name (alone or together with the name of her husband, Amenophis III) demonstrates beside many other
monuments the very special role of this queen, and her political and religion importance.



"name: Ancient Art Scarab with a Cobra and Script Signs,Egyptian"
Description: This steatite scarab has a flat underside with a vertically arranged design in sunk relief. The design depicts a winged cobra with a raised
head, shield, and tail, a crossed-line pattern beneath her body, and a sun disc between her wings. The back is incised with deeply incised
details. The piece is poorly made and the workmanship is rough. The scarab functioned as a provider individualized amulet, and was
originally mounted or threaded. The amulet should protect its owner and provide the support of Amun. The Egyptians used winged cobras
as protective icons in many different contexts, mostly in combination with royal or divine names or images.



"name: Ancient Art Scarab with Script Sign Combination,Egyptian"
Description: This steatite scarab has a flat underside with a vertically arranged design with a 'Maat' and longevity/omnipresence of Amun theme
composed of four signs lacking syntactical context. The design of the back is simple with unbalanced body proportions and good
workmanship. The piece is carefully made. This scarab functioned as a supportive amulet and should secure life and justice. The piece
could serve in this world and in the afterlife; as Amun's trigram, it should assure the support of the god. It would have originally been
mounted or threaded.



"name: Ancient Art Statue of a Monkey with Young,Egyptian"
Description: The small statuette represents a seated female monkey with one of its young on its lap. Its left hand rests on the left upright leg, and with
its right hand it eats a fruit. Monkeys were popular in Egypt and were depicted in tomb paintings as companions of the people in the fields,
as well as musicians and dancers.



"name: Ancient Art Model of a Bust of a King,Egyptian"
Description: This model has been carved in the round. It depicts a King wearing a wig with a uraeus. There are squares drawn on the bottom, sides,
and back. The corners of the wig are broken off. The King's left ear is glued on and had been broken off. The eyes are painted. The
authenticity of this piece has been questioned.



"name: Ancient Art King Standing,Egyptian"
Description: This statue is sculpted in the round, and depicts a King standing with a uraeus on his forehead. He wears a long wig, and has a stele at
his back. His nose has been restored. The statue is broken off across the legs with holes from previous restorations. The eyes are hollow,
and fitted with paste.



"name: Ancient Art Sistrum,Egyptian"
Description: The sistrum is a musical rattling instrument that was popular in the cult of the goddess Hathor. Called a ""seshsehet"" in Egyptian, the
name imitates the swishing sound the small metal disks made when the instrument was shaken. Priestesses and royal women
participating in rituals and ceremonies at temples and shrines played the sistrum. The face of the goddess Hathor is depicted with cow
ears on the handle of the rattle.



"name: Ancient Art Heart Amulet,Egyptian"
The ancient Egyptians regarded the heart as the source of human intellect, memory, conscience, and passions. Believed to embody one's
true character, the heart was weighed on the balance of the Court of the Underworld to ascertain if the owner was worthy of being reborn
in the afterlife. Heart amulets were part of the amulet set of the deceased beginning in the New Kingdom. The meaning of such heart
amulets may be that of a substitute for the real heart. Several spells from ""The Book of the Dead"" deal with the danger that could arise if
the heart was taken away from a person, or damaged; it was thought that such a separation could destroy his/her existence in the
afterlife.



"name: Ancient Art Raqqa Lusterware Bowl,Islamic"
Description: In Arab countries and Muslim realms in the Mediterranean region, artistic innovation flourished in the 9th-14th centuries. Lusterware was
among the most original development of Arab potters, who mixed silver sulfides and copper oxides to create a shiny, metallic sheen on
the surface of glazed earthenware bowls, plates, and other utilitarian vessels, such as this Raqqa lusterware bowl.



"name: Islamic Art Model with the Head of a King and a Head with a Cap,Egyptian"

Description: 

"name: Ancient Art Block Statue of Irt-Hor-Erow,Egyptian"
Description: This block statue depicts a figure in squatting position. It has an inscription on the sides and front of the kilt, and in columns on the rear.



"name: Ancient Art Signet Ring with Name of King Akhenaten,Egyptian"
Description: This heavy gold signet ring bears the throne name of the Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten (1351-1334 BCE). It was cast in one piece; the
deeper parts of the hieroglyphics were cut into the model before casting and the finer details chased onto it afterwards. The hieroglyphs
on the bezel of the ring are not consistent with the style of the Amarna Period (particularly the shape of the kheper-beetle, as well as the
nefer-sign next to it). The ring was bought in Cairo in 1929 and it is possible that it was produced in Egypt in the time of the excavations at
Amarna (capital of Akhentaten in Middle Egypt) in the early 20th century or shortly after.



"name: Ancient Art Horus Stele,Egyptian"
Description: The Horus-stele, or cippus, was one of the most important items associated with magic in ancient Egypt. At the center of these stone
slabs was the nude figure of the child Horus, or Harpocrates, associated with the newborn sun, with the head of the god Bes above him.
Horus-the-Child, the son of Isis, stands on two crocodiles and holds dangerous animals (snake, scorpion, lion, and antelopes) in his
hands, demonstrating that with supernatural powers even a child can overcome dangers. Texts and magical scenes occupy most of the
empty space. Larger examples of these Horus-steles were placed in temple precincts, where priests poured water over them to absorb
the magical power of the spells and images. Drinking the water, it was believed, would protect against the harmful bites of dangerous
creatures as well as other dangers and evils. Smaller versions were used at home, and very small ones were worn as amulets.



"name: Ancient Art Statue of Osiris on a Throne,Egyptian"
Description: Osiris, considered to have been the first king of Egypt (and was representative of the human civilization and divine order), was murdered
by his brother, Seth, (representative of the power of the world and uncivilized nature). Magically resurrected by Isis, Osiris is typically
shown as a mummy with kingly attributes, including the ""atef"" crown-a variation of the ""white crown"" of Upper Egypt flanked by plumes-
a long beard, the crook, and the flail, or whip.



"name: Ancient Art Lotus Bowl,Egyptian"
Description: This bowl is decorated with a raised design underneath the glaze. Bowls of this lotus design were exported from Egypt all over the
eastern Mediterranean, especially to the Aegean islands and Anatolia (Asia Minor).



"name: Ancient Art Goddess and Ramesses II,Egyptian"
Description: This is a small statuette of Pharaoh Ramesses II and a goddess made of carnelian. Both the goddesses Hathor and Isis are mentioned in
the inscription on the back pillar. The piece is inscribed in two columns of text on the back pillar and the cartouche of the Ramesses II
inscribed under the base. The two figures stand against a wide back pillar, on a low base. The goddess stands on the proper left with her
arm around the shoulders of the king. The right half of her face and her left foot have been broken away. She wears a low modius crown,
tripartite wig and a sheath gown which is trimmed at the ankle and belted at the waist. The top of the king's head is level with the top of
the crown of the goddess. He is depicted as a youth with a side lock and the index finger of his right hand raised to his lips. He wears a
pleated mid-calf length kilt with a pendulous sash. Both figures are adorned with a uraeus, bracelets and armbands. Although the face is
quite small, the typical smiling mouth of Ramesses II is visible.



"name: Ancient Art Head of a Man,Egyptian"
Description: This is the head of a man, whose headdress is rendered in the style of the Old Kingdom elite. It is broken at the neck.



"name: Ancient Art Male Head,Egyptian"
Description: This male head is carved in the round and is broken off at the neck. The man's hair is in rows of rectangles, as are Old Kingdom heads.



"name: Ancient Art Panel Portrait of a Bearded Man,Egyptian"
Description: Prior to the Roman Period, the likeness of the deceased on the mummy mask, coffin, and sarcophagus was an idealized representation
that conformed to the general style of the period. With the arrival of Roman rule in Egypt, mummy portraits became increasingly
naturalistic. The new style of portraiture was sometimes rendered in two-dimensional paintings on a wood panel or on linen. The panel
portraits were made in either tempera paint or in encaustic, like this example. Encaustic painting is a technique in which the pigment is
dissolved in wax before it is applied to the surface.



"name: Ancient Art Head and Bust of a Woman,Egyptian"
Description: This painted bust has the back of a chair broken off around the edge of the head. The piece is probably a forgery.



"name: Ancient Art Relief with Onuris-Shu,Egyptian"
Description: Here, the god Onuris-Shu holds an ankh, the hieroglyphic sign for life, in one hand and a was scepter, an animal-headed staff symbolizing
power, in the other. Four plumes rise from a circlet atop his short wig, and a protective uraeus (sacred cobra) rises from his brow. The god
wears a long, sheer, patterned garment, a divine beard, a wesekh, or beaded broad collar, and a necklace with a shrine-shaped pendant.
A portion of the hand and scepter of another divine figure remain behind Onuris-Shu. The inscriptions suggest that the relief was once
part of a scene of adoration.



"name: Ancient Art Statue of Tef-ib,Egyptian"
Description: Tombs sometimes contained more than one statue representing the owner. The statues were usually inscribed with the owner's name
and titles, and they served as a focus for funerary rituals. These examples, belonging to a man named Tef-ib, are unusual in that they
represent the tomb owner while also bearing inscriptions referring to the four sons of Horus, who protected the internal organs of the
deceased. These deities were also identified with the north, south, east, and west, and the statues may have been placed in the tomb in
accordance with these directions. The differing facial features of these statues (including Walters 22.10, 22.11, 22.13) suggest that they
were made by more than one artist. Notice as well, the sizes of the four figures differ as well as their wigs.



"name: Ancient Art Khnum,Egyptian"
Description: Khnum holds a whip in his right hand. The inscription says that this votive figure was dedicated by King Psametik. As in large scale
Egyptian granite standing or striding figures, there is no space between the legs, and the arms are kept close to the body. The headdress
has broken off.



"name: Ancient Art Sculptor's Model with a Relief of a Goose,Egyptian"
Description: Known as ""the Great Cackler,"" Geb was said to have laid the cosmic egg that contained the sun and, thus, was honored as the father of
the gods. The image of a goose is also a script sign and was used to write the term ""son."" This term was an important part of the royal
titulary system, as in the title ""Son of Re (sun god).""
Description: 

"name: Ancient Art Harpokrates (Horus the Child),Egyptian"
Description: Nude Harpokrates stands in a marked S-curve; his legs are broken and missing below the knees, while the arms, apparently
mechanically riveted on, are lost. Comparisons with other representations of Harpokrates suggest that he held a cornucopia in his proper
left arm and put his right index finger to his mouth, as a gesture representative of children. He wears the combined crown of Upper and
Lower Egypt. His wavy hair is bound into a top knot above his forehead and is partially braided in the back. The eyes would have held
inlays.



"name: Ancient Art Horus Stele,Egyptian"
Description: The Horus-stele, or cippus, was one of the most important items associated with magic in ancient Egypt. At the center of these stone
slabs was the nude figure of the child Horus, or Harpocrates, associated with the newborn sun, with the head of the god Bes above him.
Horus-the-Child, the son of Isis, stands on two crocodiles and holds dangerous animals (snake, scorpion, lion, and antelopes) in his
hands, demonstrating that with supernatural powers even a child can overcome dangers. Texts and magical scenes occupy most of the
empty space. Larger examples of these Horus-steles were placed in temple precincts, where priests poured water over them to absorb
the magical power of the spells and images. Drinking the water, it was believed, would protect against the harmful bites of dangerous
creatures as well as other dangers and evils. Smaller versions were used at home, and very small ones were worn as amulets.



"name: Ancient Art Male Head,Egyptian"
Description: This male head is carved in the round and has eyebrows in relief. It is a fragment, broken off at the neck. The man's nose and ears are
slightly damaged.



"name: Ancient Art Seated Athlete,Egyptian"
Description: This figureâ€™s hairstyle and clearly damaged ears (often described as â€œcauliflower ears,â€​ the likely result of sustained trauma to
the head) indicate he is an athlete. Possibly a wrestler or a boxer, he reclines wearily, perhaps after a match. His eyes and tongue are
inlaid with silver.



"name: Ancient Art Hippopotamus,Egyptian"
Description: This small figure displays a standing hippopotamus. Figures such as this may have been votives.



"name: Ancient Art Naturalistic Scarab,Egyptian"
Description: Naturalistic scarabs, which exhibit a beetle-formed underside instead of a flat bottom with additional motifs, became popular in the late
Third Intermediate and Late periods. They were attached to the mummy bandages and were part of the amulet set. There are two
varieties of such scarabs: red carnelian and blue-green faience scarabs. It is likely that the blue-green scarabs focus only on the renewal
aspect, while the red carnelian scarabs were related to the sun rise/set aspect and gave special protection at the critical transition phase.



"name: Ancient Art Intef Seated on the Ground,Egyptian"
Description: This statue shows its owner, Intef, seated cross-legged on the ground. He rests upon a small platform, wearing a kilt which covers his
entire lower body including the feet. The hands are resting upon his thighs. The head is covered by a wig which is tucked behind the ears
and hangs down behind the shoulders. The face is idealized, with schematically rendered ears. The brows are modeled, the eyes narrow.
The mouth is curved in a slight smile, the philtrum is indicated. The man bears a small beard or goatee on his chin. The musculature of
the body is summarily indicated. The pose was first used during the Old Kingdom and regained popularity during the Middle Kingdom. An
offering text is inscribed on the base, and a text on the lap records Intef's title and his mother's name.



"name: Ancient Art Kneeling Figure of Hor-wedja,Egyptian"
Description: Hor-wedja was the son of Vizier Sasobek, the highest-ranking official during the reign of King Psammetichus I. Hor-wedja's son Meryptah
commissioned this temple sculpture for him. Hor-wedja kneels, presenting only himself to his god. He abases himself in the deity's
presence but keeps his head erect, expressing respect and confidence. A hieroglyphic inscription gives the lineage and titles of Hor-wedja
running in a horizontal band around the base, in a line across the top of the base and in a single vertical column on the back pillar. Hor-
wedja kneels upon a rectangular base and his toes are splayed out in an unnatural way. He wears a belted shendyt kilt and a simple bag
wig. The wide width of the wig is common for the Saite Period. The orientation of the wig onto the top of the back pillar is echoed in other
sculptures from the 26th Dynasty through the reign of Apries. As is characteristic for the Saite Period his image is quite idealized. The
body appears strong but the definition of the musculature is subtle. A strong median line is visible. His hands are placed flat upon his
thighs and appear unusually plump. His facial features are also typical for the Saite Period: long almond-shaped eyes with straight brows
above, long smooth cheeks, a long straight nose and a softly smiling mouth. The statue is well preserved and the polish is only marred by
a few minor nicks.



",Ancient Art "Model with a Male Figure, a Human Leg, and Part of a Lion"name: Egyptian"
This model is carved in low relief. On the front is a male figure with a long wig. The back depicts a human leg, and the paw and tail of a
lion. Parts of this model are broken off.



"name: Ancient Art Horus Falcon,Egyptian"
Description: The falcon rather crudely carved of lapis lazuli has the remains of a headdress made of gold foil attached to a rather battered brow. The
piece is perforated behind the legs and was probably part a necklace or a collar.



"name: Ancient Art Standing Man,Egyptian"
Description: Once part of a statue placed in a temple as a votive gift, the sculpture shows an elderly man with firmly set facial features. When
complete, the statue showed the owner offering a ""naos"" or shrine, to his god. Signs of age, with hints of bittersweet emotion, appear
only in the private sculpture of the Late Period and Ptolemaic Period, never in royal works. This is in direct opposition to works of the
Middle Kingdom where signs of age, weariness, and care appeared first in royal facial features.



",Ancient Art "Horus, Amun, Sakhmet and Ptah"name: Egyptian"
Description: Horus and Amun flank Sakhmet and Ptah who are seated.



",Ancient Art "Corner Relief Fragment with King Ptolemy II Philadelphos, Mehyet, and Onuris-Shu"name: Egyptian"
Description: The patron deities of ancient Samannud, the war and air god Onuris-Shu and his lioness-headed mate, Mehyet, are shown enthroned on
the outer face of this block. Originally, a king would have stood before them presenting offerings. Both gods hold an ankh (life symbol) and
a scepter: his is the was scepter (symbolizing prosperity and dominion), hers is a papyrus scepter. On the inner face of the block, a king
presents a floral offering to the divine couple, but only part of Onuris-Shu's figure remains.



"name: Ancient Art Mold for a Heron Plaque,Egyptian"
Description: This mold depicts a heron, a bird associated with the sun, the annual flooding of the Nile, and the afterlife.



"name: Ancient Art Standing Amarna King,Egyptian"
Description: This small and somewhat ungainly figure of a king represents that remarkable period of religious revolution when Akhenaten (1352-1336
BCE) introduced the worship of his personal god, the Aten, the orb of the sun. Although the ruler represented by this tiny bronze image is
not known, the details of dress and body confirm the dating. The so-called Nubian wig that slants from back to front was popular in this
era, as was the pleated kilt that hugs the thighs and features a long front sash. The body type is also of this era, when the king's figure
was deliberately elongated at the torso and enlarged in the chest and hip region. Most characteristic of all is the crescent shape of the
navel, which narrows to a point at the bottom. The shape recalls one that naturally appears when the stomach is distended by plumpness
and wrinkling; the art of the Amarna era was above all naturalistic. The figure's broad collar establishes a date for the work; such collars
were not represented covering the shoulders until this precise time period, when the fashion for draping the necklace onto the arms
emerged. Numerous images of Amarna kings wearing this collar show the same detail. The small king is solid cast; while the arms and
legs are poorly modeled, the necklace and kilt are carefully detailed. Study of this piece has indicated that the bronze was originally
gilded.



"name: Ancient Art Block Statue of Nes-Ba-Neb-Dedet,Egyptian"
Description: This figure is a squatting priest who has his hands crossed o his knees. There is an inscription on the sides of the pedestal, the front of
the dress, and the rear columns.



"name: Ancient Art Pataek,Egyptian,,Ancient Art Standing Amen,Egyptian"
Description: The gold inlay on this statuette is especially noteworthy.



"name: Ancient Art AppliquÃ©: Head of a Lion,Egyptian"
Description: This plaque was used as an attachment for a piece of furniture or a box. The head of the lion is carefully molded, and the structure of the
mane incised. Lions were connected to the king, and were also a manifestation of the horizon.


"name: Ancient Art Sacred Eye Udjat,Egyptian"
Description: The Udjat-eye (also called Horus-eye) was one of the most popular amulets in Ancient Egypt. The eye symbolizes legitimate kingship, it
secures the life of the sun-god, and also of other deities, as well as human beings. In the Horus myth the eye was stolen from its
legitimate owner Horus, by Seth, the god of the wild, powerful, and untamed nature. This violent act caused disorder in the universe, and
the eye had to be brought back to reestablish order, and to heal in its place with Horus. As an amulet the Udjat-eye should secure life in
this world and in the afterlife, protect health, and promote healing. The standardized form of the amulet combines the human eye with the
cheek marking of a falcon and the tear marking of a cheetah. Besides the right Udjat-eye there is also a left version. While the right eye is
connected with the sun, the left eye represents the moon. Most of the Udjat-eye amulets have a green-blue or red color; in this case
different colors are combined to reflect the polychromy of life and nature.



"name: Ancient Art Vessel with Garlands and Griffins,Egyptian,,Ancient Art Psametik-mry-Re Holding Osiris Figure,Egyptian"
Description: The statue represents the charioteer Psametik-mry-Re. He stands holding a large figure of the god Osiris, Lord of the Underworld. Such
""Osirophorus"" figures were popular during the Egyptian Late Period (7th-4th century BCE). They were placed in temples to guarantee
the participation of the person depicted in the rituals for the gods.



"name: Ancient Art Amun-Min-Kamutef,Egyptian"
Description: The representation of the mummiform Amun-Min-Kamutef with an erect phallus alludes to his role as a fertility god. His right arm is raised
in a gesture of rejoicing. The name Kamutef (""bull of his mother"") conveys that the god is both father and son and, therefore, self-
created. Instead of the god's usual tall, feathered crown, this statuette (a rare example) depicts the god wearing the crown of Upper

Description: This steatite scarab has a flat underside inscribed with the throne name of Thutmosis III (1479-1425 BCE) and a sphinx trampling on an
enemy. The scarab has a high back with a very detailed design of deeply incised lines. The design of the bottom is rough and poorly
made, but the top is more elaborate. This piece functioned as a individualized amulet, and was originally mounted or threaded. The
amulet should secure the royal authority and divine power for the king, and provide a private owner with his royal patronage and
protection.

"name: Ancient Art Kastor and Polydeukes,Egyptian,,Ancient Art Plaque with a Dancing Dwarf with Large Phallus,Egyptian"
Description: Dwarfs played an important role in Egyptian society. Dwarfism-a genetic condition characterized by unusually short stature and shortened
limbs-is frequently represented in Egyptian tomb reliefs and statues, and the remains of dwarfs have been found in tombs associated with
the royal cemeteries. Dwarfs held important positions in the administration of the ancient Egyptian government, and they also worked as
jewelers, performed in special rituals (in which they were called ""god's dancers""), or served as midwives. Some were believed, because
of their unusual appearance, to have supernatural powers and a special relation to the gods. The dancing posture and the oversized
phallus of this dwarf-figure should secure virility and male potency for the owner in this life as well as the afterlife.


"name: Ancient Art Scarab with the Cartouche of Sheshi,Egyptian"
Description: The ancient Egyptians believed that the dung beetle, the Scarabaeus sacer, was one of the manifestations of the sun god.
Representations of these beetles were used as amulets, and for ritual or administrative purposes. This scarab has a bottom inscription,
which contains the name and title of the King Sheshi, as well as a formula wishing him life. The inscription is deeply carved with thick
lines, and the shape of the hieroglyphs is somewhat clumsy. The layout is irregularly organized, and the top and bottom signs collide with
the borderline. The incised circle-design that frames the inscription, is exact and symmetrically arranged, which contrasts with the more
sloppy forms and arrangement of the hieroglyphs; additionally, the last two signs in the lower round are very compressed, and collide with
the borderline. It is possible to explain the discrepancy between the exactly executed circle pattern and the inscription either with two
different hands - of a scribe and of a pattern cutter - or, and more likely for such a small object, with the use of a kind of compass or
stencil for the execution of the pattern. The highest point of the scarab's back is at the partition between pronotum (dorsal plate of the
protorax) and elytron (wing cases). The small, semicircular head is framed by borderlines, and the side plates are trapezoidal. The
clypeus (front plate) has four frontal serrations, and a central base notch. Two side-notches at shoulder height, which are short and not
aligned, define the partition between pronotum and elytron. The raised, slender extremities are naturally formed, and show deeply
incised, slightly irregular hatch lines for tibial teeth and pilosity (hair). The background between the legs is hollowed out, and the central
triangle shifted slightly to the front. The base is symmetrically oval, and the drill-holes are framed. The scarab is longitudinally pierced,
was originally mounted or threaded, and used as an amulet. Such an amulet should on one side secure the existence and divine
monarchy for this king, and on the other provide its private owner with his royal patronage. The identification of Sheshi with one of the
Hyksos rulers or their vassals is likely, but not secure.. The meaning of the circles' arrangement is difficult to determine; nevertheless,
given its similarity to the hieroglyphic sign of the sun disk, it may assure renewal.



"name: Ancient Art Magic Wand Depicting a Procession of Deities,Egyptian"
Description: The curve of this wand follows that of the hippopotamus tusk from which it was made but its flat form is reminiscent of the curved throwing
sticks used to catch fowl. Powerful protective deities, such as Taweret and Bes, are depicted together with protective uraeus serpents and
other mythical creatures. Many of the figures brandish knives to dispel evil spirits.



"name: Ancient Art Beaker of Nesi-Khons,Egyptian"

Description: A fragment from a statuette that once showed Isis nursing her divine son, Horus, portrays the goddess in a blue glaze, her hair set off in a

"name: Ancient Art Wall Fragment with Man Carrying an Offering Table,Egyptian"

and on the left foot. The arms may not belong to this figure. The authenticity of this piece has been questioned.



"name: Ancient Art Striding Male Figure,Egyptian"
Description: Copper figures were rare in the 3rd millennium BCE, and the few examples represent kings and, during the Middle Kingdom, also some
high officials. However, this statuette of a private man dates as early as the Old Kingdom and is, therefore, unique. It has lost its original
base and, wit it, the name and title of the owner, but the material itself indicates that he must have been an important person. The figure
was solid case and may have been placed in the tomb of its owner. The man stands with the right leg forward and clenched fists. He
wears a short kilt and a very simple wig, which does not show evidence of any decoration. The smoothed surface reveals the delicate and
careful modeling of the thick lips and wide open eyes, with the head placed on a short stubby neck. The torso has a bipartite division. The
feet have stubs with a sign of breakage. The stubs originally held the statuette in place on its base.



"name: Ancient Art Head of a Man,Egyptian"

"name: Ancient Art Infant Dionysus,Egyptian"
Description: Standing with his weight on his right leg, left leg back as though taking a step, this child lifts his gaze up and to his left, as he also raises
his left hand. The right arm is missing below the shoulder, as is much of the right foot. The childâ€™s hair is arranged in tight ringlets
around his face and the back of his neck; the curls are bound into a top knot above his forehead. The hair on top of his head is pressed
flat and held by a wide diadem; wave patterns indicate the texture of the hair, and he may have a short braided section at the top of his
head. The child is otherwise nude but may have worn a small garment, such as an animal skin, across his torso, as perhaps indicated by
the fact that no nipple is rendered on the left. Statuettes of infant Dionysus wear animal skins in this manner. The head is
disproportionately small compared to the rather solid body, and the eyes are disproportionately large on the head. The lips would have
been inlaid, perhaps with copper (now missing), and there are traces of silver inlay on the eyes.

Description: King Ramesses II wears a headdress combining the royal nemes head cloth, with the double-crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. Note the
king's royal beard, considered to be an attribute of the gods. Kings wore false beards (held in place by a cord) to portray themselves as
living gods. The inscribed belt buckle contains the hieroglyphs forming his throne name, User-Maat-Re Setep-en-Re. The king would
have had five names in total, this name and three others acquired when he assumed the throne, and Ramesses, his birth name. To his
right, another figure was once placed, most likely a god or goddess.



"name: Ancient Art Cylinder Seal with Titles and Personal Names,Egyptian"
Description: This early cylinder seal is inscribed with hieroglyphic signs that spell the personal names Nefer-Maat-Ked and Nefer-Sobek, as well as
some enigmatic titles. Although the original context of this seal is unknown, several examples of sealings and seals that include the name
of an official Nefer-Maat-Ked have been excavated in multiple sites across Egypt. Nefer-Maat-Ked seems to have been an official under
several kings, including Khasekhemwy (ca. 2649 BCE), the last king of the Second Dynasty, and Third Dynasty king Djoser, the builder of
the Step Pyramid at Saqqara (ca. 2667-2648 BCE). This cylinder seal acted as an administrative tool, connecting its owner with the
central royal authority.

"name: Ancient Art Box (Pyx),Islamic"
Description: This ivory object, along with others in the Walters collection, were created by Muslim craftsmen, probably working in Palermo, Sicily, for
the Christian court of the Norman rulers (11th-13th century) and were intended for personal use as containers for perfumes, cosmetics,
and jewelry. Many such small boxes and coffers, decorated with typically Islamic motifs such as birds, animals, and geometric designs,
eventually ended up in Europe and took on a Christian function. They were often placed on church altars to hold the Host (Communion
wafer) for the Mass and sometimes were even transformed into reliquaries to contain the remains of saints. Preserved in church
treasuries, these examples of secular Islamic art were admired and copied by European artists making Christian liturgical vessels.

black paint of the tripartite wig has begun to mineralize and flake off. A broad collar is outlined in black and red between the modeled wig
lappets. The face and hands of the figure are painted red. The details of the face, including the cosmetic lines of the eyes are accented in
black. The figure holds two scythes against his chest and two baskets over his shoulders but these are merely painted in red and not
modeled in relief. The arms, although covered in the mummiform shroud are modeled in relief, crossed over the chest and the hands are
visible. This ushabti, purchased from the colleagues of tomb artists, exhibits superior workmanship.

the gills on the underside of the fish; this hole may have accommodated a rope or wire of some kind. The glaze has been rubbed off in
the mouth region. This fish may have served as a vessel or ritual object.



",Ancient Art "Pendant, Horus with Falcon Head"name: Egyptian"

48.1705, 48.1708, 48.1709, 48.1710 and 48.1711) suggest that they came from the same workshop. Represented here is the falcon-

"name: Ancient Art Ushabti Figure of Ka-ha,Egyptian"
Description: Ushabti (meaning ""answerers""), also called ""shawabti,"" which resemble miniature mummies, were made mostly from inexpensive
materials such as wood or Egyptian faience. These funerary statuettes represent the individual whom they accompanied into the tomb
and the afterlife. If a god called on the deceased to perform labor, this servant substitute, magically invoked by a traditional spell, would
answer and do the work on behalf of the tomb's owner. This ushabti served as a proxy for the ""chief painter Ka-ha,"" who worked at Deir

many evils.

Description: This sculpture of the head of a king has a uraeus on the forehead. His hair is divided into rectangles. There is a head of a hawk at the
back of his neck. The uraeus is broken and the piece is broken off at the neck. The face has been inserted, and the piece is a forgery.


"name: Ancient Art Plaque with Sphinx and Duck,Egyptian"
Description: This steatite amulet is incised with sunk relief designs on both the front and back. The carvings on the front depict a sphinx, while those
on the back show a duck. The figures fill most of the image field, and empty spaces above the backs display floral elements. Hatch and
crossed line patterns define the inner structures. The workmanship is slightly rough and the piece is simply made. This amulet had divine
kingship connotations, and was originally mounted or threaded. It could be a rotating element of a ring with two different focuses: It should
ensure magical protection as well as regeneration for its owner. The representation of a duck with head bent back is typical for the early
18th Dynasty, and double-sided decorated oval plaques for the reign of Thutmosis III (1479-1425 BC)-Amenophis III (1388-1351/1350
BC). However, this plaque belongs not to the standard types. Most of the duck representations are scaraboids, and not incised figures on
a plaque, and the figure of the jumping/running hawk-headed sphinx is very unusual, as are the attached elements. The only comparison
to the jumping/running posture one can find is in images of running lions.



"name: Ancient Art Stele with the Divine Triad,Egyptian"
Description: This sunk relief stele depicts the divine triad of Elephantina, Khnum (ram-headed), Satet, and Anqet. Below is a priest with an ointment jar
in his hand kneeling before offerings.



"name: Ancient Art Sculptor's Model of a Lion,Egyptian"
Description: This statuette of a resting lion was most probably used as a donation into a temple or shrine.



"name: Ancient Art Hippopotamus,Egyptian"
Description: This figure of a hippopotamus has a platform on its back. The hooves are indicated schematically. A ridge suggests the eyes. File marks
remain on the surface of the dense ivory. There are some cracks and the snout is partly broken off. The style of the carving is unusual.
The platform here may imitate the hollowed projections for ointments on the backs of other hippopotamuses of the period.



"name: Ancient Art Cylinder Seal with the Names of King Sahure and Titles,Egyptian"
Description: This silver cylinder seal features the royal titulary of King Sahure, the second king of the Fifth Dynasty (ca. 2487-2475 BCE). The
inscription includes four serekhs with his Horus name (Nebkhau), his Nebti name (Nebkhau), his Golden Horus name (Bikwy-Nebu), and
one cartouche encircling his birth name (Sahure). The seal is also inscribed with the titles of a high official, including â€œoverseer of the
leather workers.â€​ This cylinder might have come from Abusir where the king built his pyramid and most likely his unexcavated sun
temple.



"name: Ancient Art Inlay of a Falcon,Egyptian"
Description: The inlay represents a falcon depicted without many details. Glass was used in Egypt not before the Thutmosidic Period. This piece is
somewhat crude and may either belong to one of the first test examples or was created by an inexperienced glass maker.



"name: Ancient Art Pair of Leather Sandals,Egyptian"
Description: This is a pair of leather sandal soles. Each sole consists of a single piece of cut leather. There are fine cracks and some areas of
discoloration on the reddish-brown leather, but generally it is in a good state of preservation. The sandals appear to have been worn
during life because there are signs of wear on the bottoms and there are molded impressions of the heal, toes and the ball of the foot on
the upper surface. There is a round hole punched into each sole for the attachment of a thong between the first and second toes. Leather
ankle straps secured the back of the sandal. Complete examples in the Museum of Fine Arts have a strap that completely encircles the
ankle heel. On the right sole only an indentation on each side marks the location of the sandal strap. On the left sole a small section of
the original strap remains on the right edge and this strap was part of the same piece of leather as the sole. On the left edge we have
evidence of a repair, which is also an indication of daily life use. Two holes were punched into the edge of the sole and a new strap was
fixed into place by leather thongs. Only a short length of this new strap remains in place. There is a rectangular area of discoloration on
the upper surface of the left sole near the toe area.



"name: Ancient Art Taweret,Egyptian"
Description: This pendant of Taweret is broken at the legs. Taweret was standing with both hands pressed to her sides and holding the hieroglyph for
""protection.""
Description: 

"name: Ancient Art Head of Ptolemy II,Egyptian"
Description: In 332 BCE, Alexander the Great freed Egypt from Persian control and made it part of his growing empire. One of his generals, Ptolemy
Lagus, was sent to Egypt to serve as governor after Alexander's sudden death in 323 BCE. Ptolemy eventually crowned himself king and
founded the Ptolemaic Dynasty. One of the early rulers of this Dynasty is represented in this elegant, life-size head. The Ptolemaic rulers
were sensitive to the political needs of their diverse subjects. Therefore, royal portraiture is mainly of two types, one in strictly Egyptian
style, like this head, and the other purely Greek.



"name: Ancient Art Vessel with Lid,Egyptian"
Description: The finest of three lidded faience baskets to survive from the New Kingdom, this example shows how the artisan tried to imitate actual
fiber baskets. Even the base of the vessel imitates coiled fiber. The vessel and its lid were held together by decoratively laced string.



",Ancient Art "Bowl with ""Kufic"" Inscriptions"name: Islamic"
Description: Ceramic vessels from early medieval Nishapur were frequently decorated with proverbs or short sayings in Arabic. The proverb here,
written in two parts, may be interpreted as: ""The loyal person is the most praiseworthy.""
Description: 

"name: Islamic Art Harpokrates (Horus the Child),Egyptian"
Description: This finely modeled figure of the young god Horus-the-Child (called Harpocrates by the Greeks) shows him, as ususal, sucking his finger.
He wears the typical juvenile sidelock, but also has short curly hair, indicated by fine incised lines. Teh deep-set eyes reveal the influence
of Greek art on late representations of this well-known Egyptian god. The legs and left arm are damaged.



"name: Ancient Art Model Torso,Egyptian"
Description: Sculpture models, such as this example, were used by artists in the Ptolemaic and Roman periods. This model appears to be complete,
despite the lack of head, arms, and lower legs. The grid lines on the legs helped to keep the proportions. The statue is dressed with a
shendit-kilt. Such models may also have served a votive purpose in a temple setting.



"name: Ancient Art Figure of Isis-Serget as Scorpion,Egyptian"
Description: The top of a scepter in the form of a papyrus column, surmounted by a pedestal supporting the figure of a scorpion with the bust of a
woman, representing the goddess Isis-Serget. Originally she wore a crown of cow horns and sun-disk. The inscription on the shaft is
badly damaged. The phrase: ""Isis may give life"" has been preserved.



"name: Ancient Art Bastet Enthroned,Egyptian"
Description: The cat-goddess Bastet could be depicted with the head of a lioness, adding an extra potency to her protection. The inscriptions indicate
that this enthroned figure of the goddess was a New Year's gift, given to celebrate the beneficial annual flooding of the Nile River.



"name: Ancient Art Relief: Queen or Goddess with Vulture Headdress,Egyptian"
Description: This relief plaque was probably a sculptor's model or study. It shows a royal or divine woman wearing the vulture headdress topped with
protective uraeus serpents. The intricate and detailed patterns of headdress, wig, and collar contrast with the smooth plains of the face.



"name: Ancient Art Bowl,Islamic,,Islamic Art Standing Pataikos,Egyptian"
Description: The dwarf god Pataikos offered protection from evil. He was a manifestation of the creator god Ptah, and became popular beginning in
the New Kingdom. The name was introduced by the Greek writer Herodotus. Representations of the god were used as amulets. This was
probably made during the 26th Dynasty.



"name: Ancient Art Standing Man,Egyptian"
Description: This anonymous official's pose is unusual. The right hand crosses the body to rest upon the left fist. The garment is also not typical. Both
probably show the influence of the Near East during this period, when Egypt was part of the Persian Empire.



"name: Ancient Art Taweret,Egyptian"
Description: While Taweret representations usually have hippo heads, this Taweret figurine is lion-headed. Taweret stands with her arms at her sides;
she does not have attributes.


"name: Ancient Art Head Fragment from a Sarcophagus,Egyptian"
Description: This human face has eyes and eyebrows that are hollow for inlay. The top is cut off roughly. The back is smooth. There are two holes in
the back for attachment, and an extention below the chin with a hole through it for attachment.



",Ancient Art "Harpocrates-Eros with Falcon, Jackal, Falcon and Serpent"name: Egyptian,,Ancient Art Ceremonial Riding Spur,Islamic"
Description: This gold piece is almost certainly a ceremonial spur. It has various protruding decorative devices including a large hemisphere welded
on, filigree, and granulation. One end is broken off.



"name: Islamic Art Pomegranate Vessel,Egyptian"
Description: This pomegranate vessel is unusual in its olive-green color, deep feather patterns, and elongated shape. While these vessels were used
in life, an object of such elegance could also be included in its owner's burial.



",Ancient Art "Male Figure, Possibly with Dwarfism"name: Egyptian"
Description: Individuals with dwarfism played an interesting role in Egyptian society since Predynastic times. Dwarfism--a genetic condition
characterized by unusually short stature and shortened limbs--is frequently represented in Egyptian tomb reliefs and statues. People with
dwarfism were believed, because of their unusual appearance, to have supernatural powers and a special relation to the gods, and some
could hold important positions in the administration of the ancient Egyptian government, they also worked as jewelers, and performed in
special rituals (in which they were called ""god's dancers""). Figurines depicting people with dwarfism were used as amulets and have
been found in tombs as well as in ritual places. This statuette of a nude male seems to be depicted with the characteristics of dwarfism.
His hands are clasped and resting on his chest; a cylindrical hole through the hands was once used to hold a staff. A square tapering
cavity has been cut into the head, probably for the attachment of a headdress. The feet are broken off above the ankles. The knees are
bent and it is possible to interpret the posture as dancing. A grouped statuette of three dancing figures with dwarfism from the Middle
Kingdom that was excavated at Lisht displays similar postures.



"name: Ancient Art Cartonnage Mask of a Woman,Egyptian"
Description: Funerary masks of the Ptolemaic and Roman periods often had gilded faces that reflected the association of the deceased with the gods.
This mask has been molded over a core, with layers of mud and linen. The decoration was applied in layers, with the gilding at the end.
The eye inlays are made from glass, as well as the blue scarab on the top of the head and the ibis inside of a pectoral on the chest. The
scarab has gilded wings which stretch down to the sides of the wig. Above the forehead is a frieze of uraeus serpents with sun-disks on
their heads. At the right and left frontal ends of the wig are recumbent jackals. A golden collar with five rows of rosettes and geometric
patterns adorns the mask, suspended from which two kneeling goddesses flank the pectoral with an ibis. The goddesses may be
identified as Isis and Nephthys, each with a sun-disk on her head and a feather-fan in one hand. Cartonnage masks were used to protect
and idealize the facial features of the deceased. The golden face of this mask shows no signs of age, gender, or emotions. The
eyebrows, nose, mouth, chin, and ears are very well modeled, but without color accents. The motif ensemble of the mask symbolizes
protection (uraeus serpents, jackals), general renewal (scarab-beetle), and divine support to pass the court of death (Thoth-ibis,
goddesses) and to be renewed in the afterlife amongst the deities (reflected in the golden color of the face).



"name: Ancient Art Ibex Head Lyre Fragment,Egyptian"
Description: This carved wooden ibex head once decorated a lyre, a stringed instrument like a small harp that was adapted from Near Eastern cultures
during the New Kingdom. The head of an ibex is depicted emerging from an open lotus flower. Between the curved horns of the ibex is a
projection with a rectangular tang. This tang would attach to the crossbar of the lyre. The angle of the piece and the shortness of its
length suggest that it was fitted as the shorter support of an asymmetrical lyre. The ibex head would have faced outward. The piece is
well preserved and the ibex is realistically rendered right down to a tiny projection representing a bearded tuft beneath the chin of the
animal. According to Peter Lacovara the base of this piece may be located in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.



"name: Ancient Art Amun and Mut Seated,Egyptian"
Description: This carved sculpture depicts Mut with the crowns of upper and lower Egypt with a uraeus, and Amun with a crown with a uraeus with a
hole for the insertion of plumes. Each holds the symbol of life. The right arm of Mut is broken.



"name: Ancient Art Falcon Shaped Horus,Egyptian"
Description: The falcon god Horus represented the sky and was also associated with kingship from the late 4th millennium. This small falcon figure is
made from gold and has a silver double-crown (which stands for Upper and Lower Egypt) attached.


"name: Ancient Art Lusterware Bowl,Islamic"
Description: In Arab countries and Muslim realms in the Mediterranean region, artistic innovation flourished in the 9th-14th centuries. Lusterware was
among the most original development of Arab potters, who mixed silver sulfides and copper oxides to create a shiny, metallic sheen on
the surface of glazed earthenware vessels, such as this bowl.



"name: Islamic Art Bust of a Queen Wearing Royal Headdress,Egyptian"
Description: This was once part of a statue showing a seated queen wearing the vulture headdress associated with queens as well as goddesses such
as Isis and Hathor. The 30th Dynasty saw the revival of Middle Kingdom motifs, such as the wig with large curls and the large ears. Late
Period details include the fleshy face, the slight smile, and the long cosmetic lines of the eyes and brows.



"name: Ancient Art Scarab with the Name of Remen,Egyptian"
Description: This polished jasper scarab is linearly incised on the flat underside with an inscription that is both vertically and horizontally arranged. The
inscription lists a private name and contains a wish formula. The top of the scarab is very simple and without lines or notches. The
proportions of the top are unusual. The workmanship of the piece is rough and it is poorly made. This scarab functioned as an
individualized funerary amulet with a wish formula, and was originally mounted or threaded. The amulet should support the justification
and well being of the deceased.



"name: Ancient Art Harpokrates (Horus the Child),Egyptian"
Description: Horus the Child was originally seated on his mother Isis's lap. Below his body is a tiny extension that inserts to the second piece, which
was the body of the mother.



"name: Ancient Art Box (Pyx),Islamic"
Description: This ivory box is decorated with roundels and drinking figures and bears an inscription in ""naskhi.""
Description: 

"name: Islamic Art Maat,Egyptian"
Description: The amulet made of a bright blue glass-like faience (?) was made in a mold with some later working. It represents Maat, the
personification of Truth, as a woman seated with knees drawn up. There is a hold in the head to attach an ostrich feather, the hieroglyph
for her name. A loop projects from the back of her head for suspension.



"name: Ancient Art Head of a Man,Egyptian"
Description: The care-worn facial features first seen on sculptures of King Sesostris III appear again in the royal sculpture of some of his successors.
The faces on statues commissioned by and for private individuals share many of the conventions applied to the monarchs. Unlike some
royal portraits, however, this official's mouth betrays a slight smile, lending it an air of dignified confidence.



"name: Ancient Art Fragment with a Head,Egyptian"
Description: This head has been carved in low relief and has hair arranged in triangles.



"name: Ancient Art Ushabti Group of a Couple,Egyptian"
Description: ""Ushabti"" group representations are quite rare and were probably gifts to the deceased from a relative. The man holds a typical hoe and
grain basket; his wife holds ""ankh"" signs, symbolizing ""life."" No inscription is visible on the piece, and it is possible that it was placed in
a special box that carried the names of the deceased couple.



"name: Ancient Art Duck Cosmetic Box,Egyptian?"
Description: The wings of this charming cosmetic container pivot outward, revealing a storage compartment. The eyes were once inlaid. The pintail
duck is one of Egypt's most common species of waterfowl and was a popular decorative motif.


"name: Ancient Art Casket with Harpies,Islamic"
Description: Seated figures are shown in central roundels on the sides and cover and in spandrels on front and back. Harpies appear in spandrels on
the sides and the cover.



"name: Islamic Art Pen Box with Inkwell,Islamic"
Description: This box once contained a pen and, in the lower compartment, a wad of wool soaked with ink. It was carried on the owner's belt and must
have belonged to a statesman, since its side is inscribed with the maxim: ""Your government shall rise without declining, if it has as its
basis the largest number of people from every place."" Hunt imagery, like the scenes on the box, was popular among the nobility as this
sport required the valor and skills also needed in battle.



"name: Islamic Art Ushabti of Ken-Amun,Egyptian"
Description: This piece is carved in the round and painted. The mummiform figure has long hair that is striped blue and white. It has a white face, and
the pupils, lashes, and eyebrows are neck. It wears painted necklaces. The arms below the elbows are not indicated. Ken-Amun was a
high official and overseer of the army recruits. The text on the body of his unusually large ushabti tells us that it was ""made by favor of
the king.""
Description: 

"name: Ancient Art Scarab of Sheshi,Egyptian"
Description: The ancient Egyptians believed that the dung beetle, the Scarabaeus sacer, was one of the manifestations of the sun god.
Representations of these beetles were used as amulets, and for ritual or administrative purposes. This scarab is a typical example of the
Second Intermediate Period. The highest point of the back is the pronotum (dorsal plate of the protorax). Two short side-notches at
shoulder height define the partition between pronotum and elytron (wing cases). The prontum is somewhat asymmetrical, and the
notches, which differ in shape and depth, are not aligned. The head sections consists of a trapezoidal head, rectangular eyes, trapezoidal
side plates with curved outer edges, and a clypeus (front plate) with central base notch. The sides of the scarab show no extremities, but
two deeply incised circular lines, which define the partition between the body and the oval shaped base. The bottom inscription contains
the name and title of the King Sheshi, as well as a formula wishing him life. The hieroglyphs are deeply carved and somewhat clumsy.
The layout is somewhat unbalanced, and the top and bottom signs collide with the borderline. The scarab is longitudinally pierced, was
originally mounted or threaded, and used as an amulet. It should secure the existence and divine monarchy for this king, and provide its
private owner with his royal patronage. There are many scarabs with the name of king Sheshi (e.g. Baltimore, Walters Art Museum, 42.17
and 42.26), which were found in Egypt, Nubia, and Palestine. Nevertheless, there are no other monuments or historical records with his
name. It is possible that the throne name of Sheshi was Maat-ib-Re, and scarabs with this name were similar popular and widespread.
The identification of Sheshi with a Hyksos rulers or one of the Hyksos vassals is likely, but not positive. Furthermore, some scholars
considered interpreting the name as a writing variant of the name of the well-known Hyksos ruler Apepi.



"name: Ancient Art Plaque with Request for the Support of Re,Egyptian or modern"
Description: This symmetrical long-oval placque has a single sided, vertically arranged inscription with column writing requesting the special support of
Re. The plaque is good and carefully made, but the inscription is roughly done. The style of the script signs and the content of the text are
unusual and without parallel. The excellent carving of the plaque and the sloppy layout of the inscription make it likely that the plaque was
an original, and the inscription a modern addition.



"name: Ancient Art Funerary Stele of Meri-neith Wah-ib-Re,Egyptian"
Description: Meri-neith Wah-ib-Re is represented twice on this round-topped funerary monument commemorating him and his parents. Beneath a
winged sun disk, the official is shown worshipping the lord of the underworld, Osiris, and his wife, Isis. In front of Meri-neith's upraised
hands is a table heaped with food and floral offerings. At the bottom, he makes a floral offering to his father, Psamtik, and mother,
Amenirdis. The arrangement of this couple almost mirrors that of the divine couple above them. Between the two scenes are three lines
of hieroglyphic text that record a request for funerary offerings on behalf of the three individuals.



",Ancient Art "Bust of a Priest Wearing ""Persian"" Garment"name: Egyptian"
Description: One of a small number of surviving busts, this was probably a model for a larger work. The garment resembles those worn by officials
when Egypt was part of the Persian Empire. The facial features are remarkable for their naturalistic rendering of old age.



"name: Ancient Art Turban Helmet with Neck Guard of Mail and Nose Guard,Iranian-Islamic"
Description: Helmets like this, which have preserved their original chain-mail ""aventail,"" or face and neck covering, have been likened to masks that
conceal the face and create a sense of mystery. Their primary function, however, was to protect the wearer. Islamic helmets often were
decorated with inscriptions that invoke God's power and blessing. Sometimes, as here, the writing cannot be easily deciphered and may
even be meaningless-the presence of letter-like designs was evidently regarded as sufficient protection.


"name: Islamic Art Plaque with a Jackal Shaped Anubis,Egyptian"
Description: A faience, mold-made amulet in the form of a small plaque with the jackal god Anubis recumbent upon a pylon shaped chest/shrine. There
is a flail over the back of the jackal. The jackal and the chest are in raised relief. The jackal faces to the right and this amulet is the mirror
image of Walters 48.1634. The glaze is a pale green except for the jackal which is bright blue. The lower and left sides are squared but
the other two are rounded, roughly outlining the shape of the jackal and the chest. Numerous funerary amulets were usually placed
among the many layers of linen strips used to wrap mummies. Specific amulets, along with their required position on the body, are listed
in funerary texts such as ""The Book of the Dead."" Amulets were sometimes sewn directly onto the wrappings or could be incorporated
into a bead net shroud covering the mummy. This amulet has been modeled with a flat underside and is pierced by tiny holes around the
edges for attachment.



"name: Ancient Art Falcon,Egyptian"
Description: The slender falcon (shaped like a dove) of lapis lazuli with simplified details of the wing feathers indicated by light incisions.



"name: Ancient Art Head of a Ichneumon,Egyptian"
Description: This carved head has red stain in the cracks and is cut off smooth across the neck.



"name: Ancient Art Horus Stele (Cippus),Egyptian"
Description: This piece is carved in high relief. Horus the Child stands on two crocodiles, and holds two sceptres with hawks, a gazelle, a lion, and a
scorpion. The wings of the hawks are on top of the rendered stele, and the head of the god Bes is placed above the head of the Horus
Child.



"name: Ancient Art Ba Bird,Egyptian"
Description: The ""ba,"" depicted as a human-headed bird, was a spiritual aspect of one's personality.



"name: Ancient Art Harpokrates (Horus the Child),Egyptian"
Description: The god of kingship is depicted as a child. He received his magical power from his mother, Isis.



"name: Ancient Art Statue of a Man,Egyptian"
Description: The artists of the Kushite rulers of the 25th Dynasty introduced a new realism into royal art and sculpture and also revitalized private
sculpture. Kushite images had a broader cheek and stronger jaw, resulting in a more angular face than had been seen before. When the
26th Dynasty supplanted the 25th, the artistic center changed from the residence of the Kushite kings at Napata in southern Nubia, to
Sais in Egypt's Delta, home to the new ruling family. The style also changed to a more idealized image with softer features. This early
26th Dynasty sculpture combines the angularity of the larger boned Kushite face with the new idealizing style of the Saite Period,
producing a strong and polished image.



"name: Ancient Art Scarab Ring Bezel,Egyptian"
Description: The sheet gold which frames the flat side of this scarab of blue translucent stone is neatly tucked into the legs of the insect. No seams
are visible. The hieroglyphs on the back are finely carved. There is an owl above and a hawk which has feathering indicated.



"name: Ancient Art Oinochoe Fragment with Queen Arsinoe III (?),Egyptian"
Description: The queenâ€™s body is depicted in mixed perspective, with her torso frontal and her head turned to her left to look at the long, slim
cornucopia she holds in her left arm. Her right arm, missing from the elbow, would have been raised up to hold a scepter or staff. A
mantle is draped over her left shoulder and wrapped around her lower body, partially covering her sleeveless chiton. Brown pigment
colors the queenâ€™s wavy hair, arranged in the melon hairstyle, around which she wears a diadem. Based on complete examples of the
oinochoe type, the queen would likely have been depicted participating in an offering scene, and an altar and a tapering column were
probably also part of the composition. Egyptian faience jugs or wine pitchers (oinochoai) of this kind were used in the cult of the Ptolemaic
rulers and always depict one of the queens of the early Ptolemaic period in high relief. This queen has been identified as possibly Arsinoe
III (died 204 BCE), wife of Ptolemy IV Philopator.


"name: Ancient Art Temple Relief of Ptolemy II Philadelphos,Egyptian"
Description: The outer face of this block shows the king behind an unnamed goddess, most probably Maat, holding an ankh (life sign). The inscription
indicates he is offering the incense to his father, the sun-god Re. The king's near hand is raised in adoration as he approaches a small
table supporting a floral offering. On the inner face, below the sky hieroglyph (pet) with a row of five-pointed stars, four vertical columns of
hieroglyphic text, read from right to left, record part of a hymn to the sun god. The readings, in part, say: (first column at right) ""Words
spoken by Horus: Brave Young Man [Ptolemy II Philadelphos] . . .""; (second column at right) ""Child of Re [Ptolemy II Philadelphos], who
rises in his right eye, who illuminates the gods . . . .""
Description: 

"name: Ancient Art Model Head,Egyptian"
Description: This limestone model is carved in low relief and depicts a head with a braid of hair at the back. The head also wears necklaces. It is set in
a frame with the back covered and has been repaired.



",Ancient Art "Iznik ""Golden Horn"" Plate"name: Islamic"
Description: This vessel dates to the 16th century, when artisans in Ottoman Turkey, working primarily in the city of Iznik, attained new levels of
technical and aesthetic achievement in the long Islamic tradition of ceramic production. Characteristic features of Iznik wares include a
hard, white body, crystal-clear glaze, a wide range of brilliant colors, and an elegant painting style. Ottoman ceramic artists took much of
their inspiration from nature and created designs incorporating both recognizable plants, flowers, and trees and stylized leaves. Chinese
blue-and-white porcelains also served as models, as on this plate decorated with delicate spirals in the ""Golden Horn"" type.



"name: Islamic Art Amulet of Horus as a Falcon,Egyptian"
Description: The combination of the crescent moon with the full moon disk leads to an identification of the hawk as the god Khonsu of Thebes. The
figure of the hawk stands on a rectangular base. When Horus wears a sun disk, he is the god of cyclical renewal.



"name: Ancient Art Priest Holding the Figure of Osiris,Egyptian"
Description: Statues such as this were placed in temples and show the owner presenting a divine image to his god. This statue represents Djed-
khonsu-iuef-ankh, a priest of the god Montu of Thebes. He holds a statuette of Osiris, god of the underworld. Priests cared for cult images
of the gods by cleaning and clothing them, as well as, offering them daily food and drink. The inscriptions on this statue indicate that it was
placed in the Temple of Montu at Karnak and was dedicated on behalf of Djed-khonsu-iuef-ankh by his son, Khonsu-mes. The owner of
such a statue benefited during his life, but also after his death, from the rituals for the god with whom he is represented.



"name: Ancient Art Zeus-Ammon,Egyptian"
Description: The god is clothed in a ""himation"" (mantle) and has a long beard and the Egyptian composite crown of Amun-Re with ram horns, sun
disk, two plumes, and a uraeus serpent on either side. He holds a thunderbolt in his left hand.



"name: Ancient Art Lionness Headed Mut,Egyptian"
Description: Every detail is shown in minute scale in this gold pendant representing the lionness head wearing a wig and double crown with a large
""uraeus.""
Description: 

"name: Ancient Art Pectoral with Scarab,Egyptian"
Description: The ancient Egyptians believed that the dung beetle, the Scarabaeus sacer, was one of the manifestations of the sun god.
Representations of these beetles were used as amulets, and for ritual or administrative purposes. The rectangular, shrine shaped pectoral
has a large scarab in the center. The front displays an adoration scene scarab and baboons in a sun barque. The shrine has a cavetto
cornice at the top with an incised winged sun disk (painted red), and a base with lotus flower frieze (in red and blue). The central scene is
additionally framed on the top and side by a color key, whose colors are mostly gone. The motif displays a scarab in a barque flanked by
two baboons in adoration gesture; the mantle of the baboons shows a crossed hatched pattern. All three figures have an extra base, the
one of the scarab decorated with a reed pattern. Below the barque is a section with a herringbone pattern, representing water. In the right
and left corner are short text columns with the name Wsjr ""Osiris."" The space around the figures was filled with red, below the barque
with blue color paste. The motif is antithetically arranged that the baboons are facing the scarab. The scarab's head, plates, and clypeus
(front plate) are carved; pronotum (dorsal plate of the prothorax), elytron (wing cases), and the division between the wing cases are
marked by raised borders to confine the color filling (pronotum: red, wing cases: blue). The extremities are carved and have hatch
notches on the upper sides for the tibial teeth and the pilosity (hair). The reverse of the shrine shaped pectoral displays an adoration
scene with Osiris and private worshipper. The flat shrine is framed by a cavetto cornice, and color key borders with four-line dividers. The
central scene displays the god Osiris on the left, crowned with double-feathers, ram horns and cobra serpents. He holds crock and flail in
his hands, and is seated on a block throne with a cushion overlapping the back. His name is written in front of his crown. The figure on the
right side represents the female owner of the pectoral; she wears a long pleated dress, a long wig that does not cover the ears, and has a
lotus flower on her head; she raises her arms in an adoration gesture. Above her hands is an inscription containing the name of Osiris.
Between both figures is an empty oval frame, which represents the juvenile sun, resting on an dd-pillar with two arms embracing the sun.
The dominating icon of the scene is the big oval in the center, and the two figures to the right and left look slightly built in comparison to it.
The figure of Osiris fills the whole height of the space including his base and crown, indicating an equal importance to the scarab. The
front and back are executed in raised and sunk relief; the front has also colored past filling. The scarab on the front is dominant by its size,
central position and raised, round sculpted forms; the two flanking baboons are also prominent by their size and the very high raised
relief; all the other details of shrine shaped pectoral are executed in high relief, except the incised wings of the sun disc in the cavetto
cornice; the layout is well organized, but the scarab and its base in the barque are lopsided; noteworthy are the rectangular raised
sections in the upper corners of the image field with the name of Osiris. Only the blue and red color has been preserved, and it is
important to realize that only the scarab has a three-color spectrum: red, blue and white or yellow/gold. The reverse side is more flatly
executed, the figures are carved in high relief; there are, as on the other side, two raised, rectangular text fields for the incised
inscriptions. The figures are slender and slightly rough; the garments are detailed with very fine hatch line or dot pattern; the layout is
balanced, but the figure of Osiris seems slim in comparison to the worshiping lady, due to his large crown and high throne base;
moreover, the central oval frame, which originally held a scarab, is lopsided. The scarab-pectoral is a funerary amulet, which was
originally attached to mummy wrappings. The amulet should assure the renewal of the deceased in the afterlife similar to that of the god
Osiris, which is why the inscription, which names the seated god, is the same as the inscription, which identifies the worshipping
deceased. The combination of sun-oval and dd-pillar of Osiris represents the unification of both deities, and of the cyclical and the linear
aspects of time and eternity; the result is the renewal of both deities, of this and the other world, as well as the deceased. While the
reverse of the pectoral focuses on the unification process, the front represents the renewal (scarab with baboons in the barque) and rising
of the sun (winged sun disc). The amulet should guarantee the meeting of the deceased with the sun god and his consequential renewal.
It is striking that on both sides the scarab is lopsided; it seems to be unlikely that this was just a mistake of a less qualified artist. Most
probably the lopsided placement has to do with the idea of the ""sloping celestial path,"" which can be expressed by a lopsided sky
hieroglyph. The motif of the scarab in the barque flanked by solar baboons is rare on private pectorals of the New Kingdom, and more
popular on scarabs (Walters 42.396), or finger rings see.

pendant depicts a ""Tilapia nilotica,"" a common species in the Nile. It was appreciated for its taste, and was also regarded as a symbol of

characteristic triangle on the forehead, wide necklaces and saddle cloth. The bull stands on a kind of sled, which divides in two and turns
up in front. The combination of the bull with a sled indicates that the statue of the holy Apis bull is represented and not the divine living
bull itself. There is a loop behind the neck to use the statuette as a pendant. The surface of the metal has deteriorated. The right rear leg
is broken off and the fore legs both have a crack which goes through the whole material.

corners of the base, and the top of the proper right ear is broken off. There is surface pitting on the upper right leg, the front of the kilt,
and the top of the head. There is black discoloration present on the back, shoulders, neck, and head. The statuette combines aspects of
Middle Kingdom sculpture with features that harken back to the sculptural style of the Old Kingdom. The Middle Kingdom preference for
hard, dark stones is evident, while the cut of the kilt is consistent with Old Kingdom models. The back pillar is inscribed with an offering
text that also records the influential official Sa-Hathor's name and title.

throne in 1294. The heraldic emblem of Kitbughaâ€™s office, a stemmed cup (inscribed in a circle), features prominently in the
candlestickâ€™s decoration. Despite its elaborate design, Kitbugha used the candlestick in his household storeroom or pantry. This base
was originally combined with a neck and socketâ€”today in Cairoâ€”which together could bear the weight of a single monumental candle.

and a ""tjet"" or knot of Isis in his left hand for protection. His face is broad and reminiscent of a funerary mask, with delicate cosmetic
lines. The mouth is well defined and almost smiling and he wears a very short squared beard. There is a modern hole beneath the feet

"name: Ancient Art Ushabti of Pa-dj-jmen-nisut-[netjeru],Egyptian"
Description: Ushabti (meaning ""answerers""), also called ""shawabti,"" which resemble miniature mummies, were made of different materials such as
wood or Egyptian faience (ceramic-like material). These funerary statuettes represent the individual whom they accompanied into the
tomb and the afterlife. If a god called on the deceased to perform labor in the afterlife, this servant substitute, magically invoked by a
traditional spell, would answer and do the work on behalf of the tomb's owner. This ushabti-figure displays its owner with a long wig and a

"name: Ancient Art Funeral Stela of Nefer-Khabet,Egyptian"
Description: At the end of the Old Kingdom, the authority of the king and court had eroded, and Egypt split into at least two distinct regions. Without a
great royal court to patronize workshops, artists and artisans worked for local governors and officials. Lively regional styles developed,
usually showing elongated, fluid figures with features such as the hands, eyes, and ears emphasized. Here, the inscriptions are an
invocation to Anubis, god of embalming and mummification, requesting funerary offerings of food and drink for the deceased. This stela,
carved in sunk relief, depicts a woman named Nefer-khabet. She wears a long, narrow, tight-fitting garment, a long wig, a collar, an armlet
and a bracelet, and anklets. Her skin is painted pale yellow, her garment is pale blue, and her various pieces of jewelry are painted a
darker shade of blue. She faces to the right and holds a blue lotus blossom with her left hand in front of her face, while her right arm
hangs down at her side. In front of her is a short, small table heaped with offerings (two basins and two loaves, a shoulder of meat,
vegetables, and more loaves); beneath it are ewer and a basin. More offerings (two baskets with food, four pottery jars on stands, loaves,
and bunches of onions) are placed to the right of this table. The offerings are painted in red, yellow, and pale green, and are surrounded
on three sides (all except the bottom) by a thin black rectangular border. Three rows and one column of inscription in blue are placed
above her and to her right. Surrounding the scene on three sides (except for the bottom) is a border consisting of pale green, yellow, red,
and black boxes, with an outline of black around them. The stela is broken on all four sides, breaking off three areas (upper left, lower left
and right) of the colored-block border. The yellow, green, red, blue, and brown colors are well preserved.

"name: Ancient Art Sculptor's Model of a King Slaying an Enemy,Egyptian"
Description: The two-dimensional model, executed in a combination of sunk and raised relief, displays a king slaying a Libyan. The king's lion is
accompanying him and bites into the left arm of the half-kneeling Libyan. To reinforce their power visually, Egyptian royal monuments
often displayed depictions of groups of foreigners bound as prisoners or in defensive positions while Egyptian sovereigns attacked.
Representatives of various Nubian groups were frequently included, along with Babylonians, Libyans, Syrians, Hittites, Canaanites,
Philistines, Amorites, and even Greeks. While some nations were conquered and captured, others were vassal states that offered tribute
or were bound to Egypt by diplomatic treaties. To depict the foreign groups, Egyptian artists standardized their clothing and hairstyles into
set â€œtypesâ€​ and emphasized any perceived physical differences from Egyptians.

crowns and four cobras with raised upper bodies on baskets. The design of the back is detailed with finely incised lines and regular line
flow. The proportions of the top are well balanced. The piece is simply made with good workmanship. The scarab functioned as an amulet
with kingship connotations. The amulet refers to all-inclusive divine protection, royal power, and perfection. The red crown symbolizes not
only the royal aspect but also magical power, and strengthens the protective function of the amulet. The scarab originally would have
been mounted or threaded.



"name: Ancient Art Squatting Baboon,Egyptian"

pillar records that Hor-wer was a member of the clergy and served three of the gods of the Theban area: Amen-re, Min, and Khonsu.



"name: Ancient Art Scarab with King as Bull Motif,Egyptian"
In addition to its original function as a personal seal, the scarab became one of the most powerful amulets, used by the living and
entombed with the dead. Countless variations have been preserved, differing in design, size, and material, but always associated with
eternity and regeneration. This scarab has a very special bottom design displaying the king as a bull trampling over a prone enemy, with
the script sign of a hoe in front of the bull's head. A Horus hawk wearing the double-crown (of Upper and Lower Egypt) is displayed in
front of the bull, and the cartouche with the throne-name of the king is above his back. Such an amulet should secure the divine,
victorious power of the king, as well as royal authority. It provides its owner with royal patronage and protection.



"name: Ancient Art Amulet of Horus the Child,Egyptian"
Description: The god Horus-the-Child seated on a pillow, knees drawn up, is carved in relief on both sides of a thin piece of lapis lazuli. A perforation

protection. Goddesses in particular were viewed as protective deities. From earliest times, Egyptian venerated a wide circle of feline-
headed female deities, such as Sakhmet, Tefnut, Wadjet, and Bastet.

This statuette of a standing Bastet has an usekh-collar with a lioness head in her hand as a protective symbol. The inscription on the base
names the donor of the figure.



"name: Ancient Art Tile with the Great Mosque of Mecca,Ottoman-Islamic"
Description: The Arabic writing in the upper part of this plaque is from the Qurâ€™an and encourages Muslims to make the hajjâ€”the pilgrimage to

the Great Mosque in Mecca, surrounded by a rectangular portico. At center is the Kaâ€˜ba, Islamâ€™s most sacred shrine and the place
to which Muslims pray. In Mecca, pilgrims walk around the Kaâ€˜ba as part of the hajj ritual. Tiles such as this one may have been
created to remind Muslims of their obligation to make the pilgrimage and introduce potential hajji, or pilgrims, to the places and practices
they would encounter. It also could have functioned as commemorative plaques for contemplation following a hajjiâ€™s experience at the
Kaâ€˜ba.

",Ancient Art "Amulet-Pendant, of Nephthys"name: Egyptian"
Description: While Egyptian jewelry was worn in daily life, most of the examples known today came from tombs, where they adorned mummies.

faience figures of gods owned by the Walters (this one and Walters 48.1676, 48.1677, 48.1679, 48.1680, 48.1684, 48.1701, 48.1704,
48.1705, 48.1708, 48.1709, 48.1710 and 48.1711) suggest that they came from the same workshop. Represented here is the goddess
Nephthys.

four (Walters 48.1638-1641). The sons of Horus protected the vital organs of the body after mummification. The figure faces proper right.
It is composed of blue glazed faience with the details picked out in purple/black manganese. The figure wears a three row broad collar, a
tripartite wig and a divine beard. There are five diagonal stripes of manganese across the mummiform body representing the mummy
wrappings or braces. Numerous funerary amulets were usually placed among the many layers of linen strips used to wrap mummies.
Specific amulets, along with their required position on the body, are listed in funerary texts such as ""The Book of the Dead."" Amulets
were sometimes sewn directly onto the wrappings or could be incorporated into a bead net shroud covering the mummy. These amulets
have been modeled with a flat underside and are pierced by tiny holes around the edges for attachment.

Description: This piece is a small serpentine, New Kingdom, block statue of Kha-em-Waset. Kha-em-Waset was a noble who held the titles of Fan-
Bearer and Chief of Works in the Temple of Amun. This statue would have been placed as a votive in the temple of Amun. Kha-em-

"name: Ancient Art Scarab Amulet,Egyptian"
Description: The ancient Egyptians believed that the dung beetle, the Scarabaeus sacer, was one of the manifestations of the sun god.
Representations of these beetles were used as amulets, and for ritual or administrative purposes. This scarab displays on the bottom side
the figure of the goddess Taweret. Her appearance combines a hippopotamus body, lion paws, crocodile head and tail, and human arms
and hands. The goddess is standing on her hindlegs, and her left arm is out stretched in front of her. Above the goddess is a human eye.
It is possible to interpret both icons as hieroglyphs, and translate: ""Taweret is watchful."" The bottom design is linearly incised, and
hollowed out in sunk relief, the depicted eye is done with very fine lines, and dominant to the figure of the goddess by its size and
placement; the figure of Taweret is, for a hippopotamus, unusually slender and elongated; the left outstretched arm with the open human
hand is very slim and long, and fills the empty space in front of the goddess; it is disproportional to her right arm, which is placed beside
her body; the whole layout is well organized, but there is more space between the eye and the upper part of the frame than between
Taweret and the lower part. The highest point of the back is the partition between pronotum (dorsal plate of the prothorax) and elytron
(wing cases). Pronotum and elytron have incised borderlines, separation lines, and V-shaped marks for humeral callosities (shoulder
thickenings). The long-oval head is flanked by quarter-spherical eyes; the irregularly trapezoidal side plates show outside-depressions,
and the clypeus (front plate) four serrations. The raise extremities have natural form, and vertical hatch lines for the tibial teeth and pilosity
(hair). The base is symmetrically oval. The bottom design is linearly incised, and hollowed out in sunk relief, the depicted eye is done with
very fine lines, and dominant to the figure of the goddess by its size and placement; the figure of Taweret is, for a hippopotamus,
unusually slender and elongated; the left outstretched arm with the open human hand is very slim and long, and fills the empty space in
front of the goddess; it is disproportional to her right arm, which is placed beside her body; the whole layout is well organized, but there is
more space between the eye and the upper part of the frame than between Taweret and the lower part. The scarab is longitudinally
pierced, was originally mounted or threaded, and functioned as an amulet. It should secure the protection of the goddess, and refer to her
watchfulness. It might have been created to protect pregnant women or newborn children. The figure of Taweret is an unusual variant with
a crocodile instead of a hippopotamus head. It is also unusual that the goddess has no nb-basket or other element below her feet to
function as a baseline.



"name: Ancient Art Naturalistic Scarab,Egyptian"
Description: The ancient Egyptians believed that the dung beetle, the Scarabaeus sacer, was one of the manifestations of the sun god.
Representations of these beetles were used as amulets, and for ritual or administrative purposes. Naturalistic scarabs, such as this, were
used as part of the amulet set of the mummy. They have a naturalistically formed belly and no additional inscriptions or motifs. The back
of this example is very high and the highest point is the pronotum (dorsal plate of the prothorax). Pronotum and elytron (wing cases) are
separated by a curved, incised partition line, and the wing cases by a vertical hatch line pattern. The quarter-spherical head is flanked by
quarter-spherical eyes that protrude from the head; the trapezoidal side plates are decorated with hatch lines, and clypeus has four frontal
serrations. The proportions of the top are slightly unbalanced, the head is small in comparison to plates and clypeus, and the pronotum is
large in comparison to the elytron. The modeled extremities have natural form and hatch notches on the frontlegs for the tibial teeth. Two
notches are at both side edges, and one at the front and rear edge. The bottom is naturally formed, and an eye protrudes from the center
of the belly. The bottom structure is standardized and the extremities visible; the round eye with horizontal drill-hole is big and protrudes
completely from the body of the beetle. The basic form of the scarab is round-oval. The scarab is funerary amulet with regenerative
function, which was attached to mummy bandages.



"name: Ancient Art Ptah with Scepter,Egyptian,,Ancient Art Head of a Crocodile,Egyptian"
Description: The crocodile is closely related to the god Sobek, who was worshipped in different places in Egypt, particularly in Kom Ombo and
Sumenu, in the Faiyum. In Ptolemaic times Sobek was connected to the sun-god Re, and therefore also to the Greek solar god Helios.
This inlay displays a very carefully worked crocodile head, which presents a lot of details such as teeth, protruding eyes, and curved
supraorbital niches.



"name: Ancient Art Head of Pataikos with Scarab,Egyptian"
Description: This dwarf-like, protective deity was very popular in ancient Egypt; amulets in the shape of this god were particularly popular from the
Third Intermediate period. The Greek name Pataikos comes from a passage in the writings of Herodotus (ca. 5th century BCE), who used
this term to describe a Phoenician protective dwarf-like image. The Egyptian Pataikos is a special manifestation of the creator god Ptah
and the dwarf-like appearance symbolizes his magical power. This head belongs to an unusual variant of Pataikos, representing him with
a snake in his mouth which winds its way up to his ears. The god has a scarab on his head. The fragment once belonged to a group of
figures standing back to back.



"name: Ancient Art Model of a Queen,Egyptian"
Description: This female figure has been carved in low relief. She is depicted standing and wears a hawk as a headdress. She holds a sceptre in her
left hand and a symbol of life in her right. There is a border at the corner. The piece has a salt deposit and has been repaired.



",Ancient Art "Female Figure, Possibly with Dwarfism"name: Egyptian"
Description: Individuals with dwarfism played an interesting role in Egyptian society since Predynastic times. Dwarfism--a genetic condition
characterized by unusually short stature and shortened limbs--is frequently represented in Egyptian tomb reliefs and statues. People with
dwarfism were believed, because of their unusual appearance, to have supernatural powers and a special relation to the gods. Figurines
depicting people with dwarfism were used as amulets and have been found in tombs as well as in ritual places. This female figurine may
have been depicted with the characteristics of dwarfism. She has a large forehead, perforations at the eyes to allow for inlay, and incised
curved ridges to denote the brow. The upper arms are fat, the chest narrow, the hips wide, and the legs short and twisted. The wide pubic
triangle is marked by a pattern of drilled holes. It is likely that this figure was used to secure fertility.



"name: Ancient Art Tile: Captive Nubian Chieftain,Egyptian"
Description: To reinforce their power visually, Egyptian royal monuments often displayed depictions of groups of foreigners bound as prisoners or in
defensive positions while Egyptian sovereigns attacked. Representatives of various Nubian groups were frequently included, along with
Babylonians, Libyans, Syrians, Hittites, Canaanites, Philistines, Amorites, and even Greeks. While some nations were conquered and
captured, others were vassal states that offered tribute or were bound to Egypt by diplomatic treaties. To depict the foreign groups,
Egyptian artists standardized their clothing and hairstyles into set â€œtypesâ€​ and emphasized any perceived physical differences from
Egyptians. This man has the large earring and tightly curled hairstyle typical of Egyptian depictions of Nubians. When complete, the tile
showed the chieftain as a bound prisoner. Such prisoner tiles could have decorated the bases of walls of royal buildings, so the enemies
of the pharaoh would be quite literally at his feet.


"name: Ancient Art Wall Painting: Woman Holding a Sistrum,Egyptian"
Description: The woman in this fragmentary painting from a tomb wall has a wig of long, full hair, held in place by a flowered headband and topped
with an ointment cone, a perfumed substance placed on wigs that gave off a fragrant aroma as it melted. A lotus blossom adorns the front
of the headband. She holds a rattle called a sistrum, which women often played during temple ceremonies. What remains of the
inscription suggests that she may have served with the temple staff of the god Amen.



"name: Ancient Art Sculptor's Model of a Vulture Hieroglyph,Egyptian"
Description: Sculptor's models were used in the workshops of craftsmen for training and demonstration purposes. This two-dimensional model,
executed in raised relief, displays a vulture. The image represents the hieroglyphic script sign ""aleph"" (which does not exist in the
English alphabet), and was a model for large-scale temple inscriptions.



"name: Ancient Art Scarab of Imeni,Egyptian"
Description: The ancient Egyptians believed that the dung beetle, the Scarabaeus sacer, was one of the manifestations of the sun god.
Representations of these beetles were used as amulets, and for ritual or administrative purposes. The bottom this scarab functions as a
private name seal, and contains the titles and name of a person, called Imeni. The text displays two, not very clear defined columns of left
reading hieroglyphic inscription, without column dividers; an oval line frames the inscription. The hieroglyphs of the bottom fill the whole
text field, but with some space in between; the layout is not very well balanced, and some of the signs collide with the borderline. The
shape of the signs is simple, and then has the typical Middle Kingdom form. The highest point of the back is the partition between
pronotum (dorsal plate of the prothorax) and elytron (wing cases), which is also defined by two side-notches, and a deeply incised
partition line. A triple division line between the wing cases, and a deep borderline, which meet slightly asymmetrically at the rear, are also
visible. The rectangular head is flanked by triangular eyes; the side plates are trapezoidal with curved outer edges, and clypeus has a
deep central base notch.. The proportions of the top are slightly unbalanced, and the head section short in comparison to pronotum and
elytron. The raised extremities have natural form and vertical hatch lines on the fore- and hindlegs for the tibial teeth and pilosity (hair); the
background between the legs is hollowed out. The base has a symmetrical long-oval shape. The scarab is longitudinally pierced, was
originally mounted or threaded, and functioned as a private name seal, and user (Imeni) individualized amulet, which should guarantee
constancy of individual existence and social status. Imeni was a very popular name in the Middle Kingdom, and Detlef Franke alone
identified twenty-one different individuals with this name. It is possible that it was the same Imeni, who left an inscription with his name
and the titles on the Sinai Peninsula in the year 42 of the reign of king Amenemhet III.



"name: Ancient Art Sesostris III,Egyptian"
Description: Usually the sculptures of kings and queens have youthful, confident, contented, and even slightly smiling facial expressions. King
Sesostris III broke dramatically with this tradition, and his face shows signs of age, concern, and discontent. He may have wished his
sculptors to show him as the shepherd of his people, heavily burdened by his care for their needs and the duties of monarchy. Among the
most important ancient Egyptian sculptures in the collection, this statue is a classic representation of an Egyptian pharaoh. He is shown
wearing the nemes head cloth (worn only by Egypt's monarchs) with a uraeus (protective serpent) at the brow, and a shendyit (pleated
kilt). An unusual feature of this king's sculpture is the amulet suspended from a necklace.



"name: Ancient Art Horus the Child Standing on Crocodiles,Egyptian"
Description: Horus the Child stands on crocodiles and controls snakes, scorpions, an oryx, and a lion. Called a ""cippus,"" this is a magical device
believed to ward off poisonous and dangerous animals and to heal those who had been bitten or stung. Liquid would be poured over the
""cippus"" to absorb the strength of the images and spells and then be drunk by, or poured on, the afflicted.



"name: Ancient Art Falcon,Egyptian"
Description: In this heavy breasted falcon carved of lapis lazuli, only the general forms, the round eyes and line across the beak are presented. There
is a peculiar sharply cut depression behind the head which suggests a ruff.



"name: Ancient Art Isis/ Hathor,Egyptian"
Description: Isis was one of the most popular goddesses in Ancient Egypt. She was the goddess of kingship, wife of the mythical king and lord of the
Netherworld, Osiris, and the mother of Horus. Her magical powers were unequalled and could even overcome death. This figure shows
Isis with the crown of the goddess Hathor, who was often associated with Isis. The crown is composed of cow-horns and a sun-disk.



"name: Ancient Art Head of a Man,Egyptian"
Description: This head has been carved in the round. The man depicted has a shaved head with a flat top.


"name: Ancient Art Scarab with Bes and Geese,Egyptian"
Description: This dwarf-like, protective deity was very popular in ancient Egypt. Bes is represented with a nude body and grotesque facial features, a
protruding tongue, and the ears and mane of a lion. He wears a tall feather-crown and usually rests his hands on his hips. Known from as
early as the Middle Kingdom (ca. 2000 BCE), Bes was venerated as a protector of the home, family, and childbirth, and for that reason
figures prominently in domestic magic and amulets. His close connection to all aspects of fertility and sexuality is demonstrated by the
presence of his image in the ""Birth-houses""-shrines associated with temples of the Late Period and the Greco-Roman era. He also had
a special relation to the goddess Hathor and performed in her retinue as a musician and dancer. On the bottom, this scarab displays the
Bes-figures in frontal view and two geese in side view. The geese may represent the god Amun, and therefore the meaning of this motif
may be related to magical aspects of Amun.



"name: Ancient Art Scarab with Unification Image,Egyptian"
Description: This steatite scarab has a flat underside with a vertically arranged bottom design combining the 'unification of the Two Lands' icon with a
basket. The design of the scarab's back is simple, with unbalanced proportions and heavy extremities. The piece is simply made and the
workmanship is slightly rough. This scarab functioned as a funerary amulet, and should secure for its owner renewal and royal protection.
It would have originally been mounted or threaded.



"name: Ancient Art Harpokrates (Horus the Child),Egyptian"
Description: Horus the Child was the son of Osiris and Isis; he was the embodiment of divine kingship. After the death of his father, Horus had to fight
to protect the throne. With the divine support of his mother, Isis, he was victorious. Horus is depicted here as a child: nude, with a side
lock, and a finger to his mouth, wearing the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. The statuette was donated by ""Hor-dj-es, son of
Udja-hor.""
Description: 

"name: Ancient Art Naos-sistrum,Egyptian"
Description: Depicted with cow features, the goddess Hathor was associated with sexuality, motherhood, and music. This sistrum, or rattle, is a
masterwork of Egyptian faience, which is particularly fitting, as Hathor was also known as ""mistress of faience.""
Description: 

"name: Ancient Art Stone Weight of Sesostris I,Egyptian"
Description: This piece is a rectangular stone weight with rounded edges. The upper surface is rounded and incised. Color variations occur throughout
the stone. There are concoidal fractures along the lower edge and the left side. The stone has a very high polish. This scale weight bears
the name of King Sesostris I and identifies him as beloved of Wadjet (the Lower Egyptian cobra goddess) and Nekhbet (the Upper
Egyptian vulture goddess). At center is the king's birth name in a cartouche. He is listed as son of the sun-god Re and beloved of the
creator-god Ptah.



",Ancient Art "Sword (""Tulwar)"")"name: Islamic,,Islamic Art Scarab,Egyptian"
Description: This faience scarab is the centerpiece of a winged scarab amulet with a flat underside and drill-holes at the bottom. The design of the
back is very detailed, with deeply incised hatch lines for the wing cases and irregular line flow. The pattern is unevenly spaced, the
proportions of the top are balanced and the extremities are slender. The piece is very carefully made, and the workmanship is good. This
scarab functioned as a funerary amulet and was originally attached to mummy bandages along with wings. Winged scarabs should
assure the renewal of the deceased by meeting the sun god in the afterlife. Friezes with a pearl pattern are not very common for scarabs
with flat undersides, but were popular for natural formed scarabs.



"name: Ancient Art Man and Child Group,Egyptian"
Description: A bearded male figure, possibly depicted with characteristics of dwarfism, is shown on his hands and knees holding a child. The man has
a pudgy nose and elongated head covered with short curls.The child's hand is preserved on the left side of the face of the man, but its
arms and head are missing. There is an unnatural protrusion from the stomach of the adult figure. A perforation from the back to the groin
suggests that this piece may have been part of a mechanical toy.



"name: Ancient Art Heart Scarab of Hati-iay,Egyptian"
Description: During the process of mummification, amulets of different kinds were placed on the body or wrapped in the mummy bindings to protect
the deceased from the dangers of the underworld. At the center of these arrangements of amulets was usually a ""Heart Scarab"", which
contained a special spell related to the ""Court of the Dead,"" a pectoral with a scarab centerpiece, or a winged scarab made of Egyptian
faience (a glazed ceramic-like material). On its right wing the scarab displays the Benu-bird in a sacred boat. And on its left wing is the
squatting figure of the god Osiris. The bottom inscription has the name and title of the owner and spell 30B of the Book of the Dead.


"name: Ancient Art Wall Fragment with Servants Bearing Offerings,Egyptian"
Description: This wall fragment is carved in low relief and depicts parts of three servants. The servants carry a water jar, a duck, a goose, staves, and
rope. This piece is probably from the same tomb as Walters 22.329, the Tomb of Nespeqashuty, 312, at Deir el-Bahri.



"name: Ancient Art Squatting Baboon,Egyptian"
Description: This squatting figure of a baboon has a loop on the back and was used as an amulet-pendant. Baboons could be representations of the
god of wisdom Thoth but they appear also as animals greeting the sun god in the morning and the evening. This pendant has no moon
disk and crescent on his head and what would be typical for Thoth- Baboon. Therefore, it may represent one of the solar baboons.



",Ancient Art Leaf from Five Poems (Quintet),Islamic,,Manuscripts Leaf from Five Poems (Quintet),Islamic,,Manuscripts Leaf from Five
Poems (Quintet),Islamic,,Manuscripts Leaf from Epic of Timur,Islamic,,Manuscripts Allegorical Group of Triumphant Ptolemy,Egyptian,"
Description: Although the group seems to represent two wrestlers, the victor's diadem (headband) identifies him as a Ptolemaic king whose victim
probably symbolizes unsuccessful Asian or native Egyptian resistance. The image of the triumphant king is inspired by a traditional
Egyptian theme, but the naturalistic rendering of the bodies shows Greek influence. The interlocking figures and the pyramidal silhouette
are distinctly Hellenistic.



"name: Ancient Art Relief with Husband and Wife,Egyptian"
Description: The sculptor Mentu-user and his wife Hepu are shown seated before a table heaped with various offerings, including a haunch of beef, a
goose, and a bunch of grapes. The inscriptions beside their heads identify them. Note that the hieroglyphs face in the same direction as
the figures. The two columns of hieroglyphs on the right are a request to the living to recite the offering text calling for fowl and a thousand
loaves of bread for Mentu-user. The red flesh tone of the man and the yellow of the woman are an artistic convention to differentiate the
sexes.



",Ancient Art "Figure of Imsety, Son of Horus"name: Egyptian"
Description: During the process of mummification, amulets of different kinds were placed on the body or wrapped in the mummy bindings to protect
the deceased from the dangers of the underworld. Figures of the four ""Sons of Horus,"" the gods who protected the containers that held
the organs of the deceased, were an indispensable part of a complete set of amulets. This figure of the human-headed god Imsety, who
was responsible for the liver, is formed in the round and has a backplate and base. The mummiform god wears a long wig and holds a
long folded cloth in each hand.

"name: Islamic Art Scarab Amulet,Egyptian"
Description: The underside of this scarab is inscribed with a spiral scroll and lotus blossom motif. Such scarabs were very popular in the Middle
Kingdom, and the Hyksos Period. The meaning of the pattern is unclear, but it seems most likely that it expresses general support or
protection.



"name: Ancient Art Prayer Rug,Ottoman-Islamic"
Description: During their daily prayers, Muslims traditionally roll out small rugs to cover the ground, creating a ritually clean space for their devotions.
Likewise, the floors of mosques, which are places of communal worship, are covered with carpets on which Muslims perform their
sequence of prayers. Islamic prayer rugs vary enormously in decoration, but they frequently feature a framed panel with twin columns
supporting an arch that represents the mihrab, or niche in the wall of a mosque, indicating the direction of prayer toward Mecca. With this
18th-century rug, the worshiper would see the arched form- and thus be reminded of Mecca- when looking down in prayer.


"name: Islamic Art Standing Pataikos,Egyptian"
Description: This dwarf-like, protective deity was very popular in ancient Egypt; amulets in the shape of this god were particularly popular from the
Third Intermediate period. The Greek name Pataikos comes from a passage in the writings of Herodotus (ca. 5th century BCE), who used
this term to describe a Phoenician protective dwarf-like image. The Egyptian Pataikos is a special manifestation of the creator god Ptah
and the dwarf-like appearance symbolizes his magical power. This Pataikos is standing on crocodiles and has knives in his hands. A
large collar adorns his neck and upper chest. The crown is quite unusual for Pataikos; it is an atef crown (combination of the Upper
Egyptian crown with flanking plumes) flanked by sun-disk-crowned snakes. A scarab, usually on top of the head of Pataikos, is instead
placed in front of the lower center of the crown. Wings are attached behind the shoulders of the god. The back pillar is pierced to function
as a loop for a pendant. This was probably made during the Ptolemaic Period.



"name: Ancient Art Head of a Man,Egyptian"
Description: This head of a man has hair behind his ears to his shoulders. It is broken off at shoulder height. The man's nose is damaged and his hair

incised with a simple design with short and aligned side-notches and a deeply incised head section. The workmanship of the piece is
rough and it is poorly made. The piece functioned as an amulet with royal motto and divine provider individualization, and was originally

"name: Ancient Art Left Side of a Double-page Illuminated Frontispiece,Islamic,,Manuscripts Standing Figure of a Male Dignitary,Egyptian"
Description: Sadly, this small figure of a standing official has lost its original base, which would have provided information on his identity, but the
outstanding quality of its workmanship and the material used indicate that it was made for an individual of very high status. This
sophisticated, small figure displays several features typical of Middle Kingdom sculpture: prominent eyes; the significant gesture of his left
hand placed upon his right breast, indicating an attitude of respect; elongated arms and hands; and the ankle-length kilt. The slight
fleshiness of the body hint at the owner's desire to be seen as successful and, therefore, well fed.



",Ancient Art "Inkwell with ""Kufic"" and ""Naskhi"" Inscriptions"name: Islamic"
Description: This inkwell is inscribed with invocations petitioning God's graces for the owner. One reads: ""With joy, divine grace, fortune, spiritual

and the hands at the mouth.



"name: Ancient Art Leaf from Qur'an,Islamic,,Manuscripts Incense Burner,Egyptian"
Description: A staff of priests and priestesses performed the daily rituals of the Egyptian temple. A chief priest tended to the cult image of the temple's
god or goddess, in the name of the king, who was thought to have daily need of food and clothing. Lesser ranking priests attended to
offerings and performed the minor parts of the temple rituals. Incense burners were used extensively in temple and funerary ceremonies
to purify the sacred space. The handle of this incense burner ends in a falcon's head. At the center is a figure of a king kneeling before a
cartouche-shaped pan that held incense pellets. The other end (now missing) was shaped like a hand holding a small pan for burning the
incense.

Description: Sculptor's models were popular teaching aids among Ptolemaic workshops. Displayed on one side of this limestone plaque, in raised
relief, is a kneeling king holding a wine jar in his hands. This carefully executed figure most likely served as a model for students. The
plaque was cut from a larger piece which also originally served for training purposes. Three finished and two unfinished ears have been
preserved, as well as a part of another ear, cut in half when the plaque was made smaller. Above the ears the beak of a vulture has also
been preserved.



"name: Ancient Art Oval Bowl with Enthroned Figure,Islamic"
Description: The enthroned king in the center of this hammered and carved bowl is flanked on the right by an attendant waving a fly whisk and on the
left by a noble or princely figure holding a beaded diadem. The ends of the bowl are adorned with dancing girls, whose long scarves fly
backward toward the central scene. Although associated with silver vessels made in Iran during the Sassanian dynasty (AD 224-651), the
vessel's shape and decoration suggest that this object dates from the early Islamic era.



"name: Islamic Art Bes,Egyptian"

"name: Ancient Art Thoth Standing,Egyptian"
Description: While Egyptian jewelry was worn in daily life, most of the examples known today came from tombs, where they adorned mummies.
Amulets provided magical protection for the wearer in both life and death. The consistent color and workmanship of the 13 light-blue
faience figures of gods owned by the Walters (this one and Walters 48.1676, 48.1677, 48.1679, 48.1680, 48.1684, 48.1701, 48.1702,
48.1705, 48.1708, 48.1709, 48.1710 and 48.1711) suggest that they came from the same workshop. Represented here is the ibis-headed
Thoth.

",Ancient Art Leaf from Five Poems (Quintet),Islamic,,Manuscripts Leaf from Five Poems (Quintet),Islamic,,Manuscripts Leaf from Five
Poems (Quintet),Islamic,,Manuscripts Striding Male Figure,Egyptian,"
Description: This piece is a wooden statue of a striding man. The arms, feet and rectangular base are all separate pieces. The sculpture is very flat
and board-like when viewed in profile. The lower half of the left arm is attached at the elbow by a hinge-like tenon. The lower part of the
left arm is darker and seems slightly more weathered than the rest of the figure. The surface of the statue is somewhat degraded and
there are a series of vertical cracks in the wood. Most of the damage has occurred to the front half of the base. The figure wears a belted,
knee-length, pleated kilt and a short round wig of rectangular plaits. The wig appears almost like a helmet because it is extended down to
chin level on the sides. The left hand is clenched around an opening for a staff and the right hand is clenched around a cylindrical object
witht the thumb extended. Often statues of this type hold a scepter of authority in their right. The limbs are long and slender. Part of the
left foot is missing. The face is flat and asymmetrical and tilted to the side. The eyes are heavily outlined on the upper eyelid. The lips are
slightly pursed and there are rounded furrows at the corners of the mouth. The same treatment of the eyes and mouth may be seen on
the statue of Kuyem-snewy (Hayes, figure 66). The authenticity of this piece has been questioned.



"name: Ancient Art Leaf from Five Poems (Quintet),Islamic,,Manuscripts Scarab with Name of Meri,Egyptian"
Description: This steatite scarab is inscribed on the flat underside with horizontally arranged writing naming an individual and making a statement of
social status. The back of the scarab is incised with a very detailed design. The workmanship of the piece is good and it is carefully made.
The scarab functioned as a private name seal, and as a user individualized amulet. It was originally mounted or threaded. The amulet
should guarantee constancy of individual existence and social status. Meri was the High priest of Amun in Thebes in the reign of
Amenophis II (1428-1397 BCE). He is well known from his tomb in Thebes, and his statue in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.

"Osiris, Lord of the Dead"name: Egyptian"
Description: This statue of Osiris seated was donated to a temple by an Egyptian official whose name is lost. The text on the base and back pillar
contains a prayer to Osiris-Wennefer (eternally incorruptible), named as the son of Nut (the goddess of the sky), head of the gods, great
god, and ruler of eternity. The crook and flail in his hands and the ritual ""atef""-crown identify him as a former king, albeit a mythical one.



",Ancient Art "Intaglio with Pataikos, Isis, and Nephthys"name: Egyptian"
Description: This intaglio depicts the god Pataikos standing on crocodiles and flanked by the goddesses Isis and Nephthys. Above the figures is a
head of Hathor with a winged sun-disk. The reverse shows an ouroboros (a snake eating its own tail) encircling a scarab beetle and the
magical ""soroor-logos"" inscription. Gems with magical icons and words were believed to be protective.

",Ancient Art Leaf from Five Poems (Quintet),Islamic,,Manuscripts Leaf from Five Poems (Quintet),Islamic,,Manuscripts Thoth as a
Baboon,Egyptian,"
Description: The figurine of the god Thoth has lost its moon disk and moon crescent on his head. The god has a necklace with a shrine shaped
pectoral around his neck. The face is not shaped as a baboon but rather depicted as a bearded man, and may have been reworked in
antiquity.



"name: Ancient Art Male Figure Standing,Egyptian"
Description: This statue has been carved in the round and painted. The piece is of fairly careful workmanship. The man wears a long skirt that is flat at
the front. His arms are at his sides, and his hands are clenched with openings. His hair is smooth and painted black. There are prongs
under both of his feet. The base is modern.



"name: Ancient Art Mummified Cat,Egyptian"
Description: Priests oversaw the rituals, mummifications, funerals, and burials of sacred temple animals. By the mid-1st millennium BC, people were
encouraged to pay for the mummification as a sacred offering to the related deity. A cat mummy would be offered to a feline deity, such as
Bastet. This was a lucrative business, and ""false"" mummies were sometimes created to meet the demand. Actually, this is one of those:
X-rays show that there is nothing inside the wrappings.



"name: Ancient Art Pectoral with Female Worshiper and Anubis on Shrine,Egyptian"
Description: A glazed steatite pectoral with incised design. On the front a woman wearing a perfume cone worships the jackal god Anubis resting on a
shrine. Above him are two hieroglyphic signs: the ""udjat"" for protection and a collar signifying ""gold."" On the back a ""djed"" pillar
(meaning eternity) is flanked by two ""tjet"" signs, (meaning protection) symbolizing also Osiris between Isis and Nephthys.



"name: Ancient Art Standing Woman Before a Broad Stele,Egyptian"
Description: This standing woman has her arms at her side. She wears hair down to her shoulders and a tight dress. There is an inscription on the
back of the stele. The piece is broken across the lower legs.



"name: Ancient Art Hippopotamus with Aquatic Flower Decoration,Egyptian"
Description: This blue faience figurine is in the shape of a walking hippopotamus, although its legs have been removed. The painted black lotus buds
and aquatic plants on its back evoke the hippopotamusâ€™s Nile environment. A hippopotamusâ€™s back rising out of the surface of
the water evoked the first mound of creation from which the sun god emerged and life began. Lotus buds, too, were connected with
creation and renewal, and thus this figurine was probably associated with rebirth and regeneration. Blue faience hippopotamuses were
popular in burials of the Middle Kingdom through the Second Intermediate Period and could assist the deceased in the process of rebirth.
The legs of this hippo were deliberately removed in ancient times to safeguard the deceased. The power of this creature was so great
that preventative measures had to be taken to ensure it did not attack the deceased in the afterlife. Ancient Egyptians saw
hippopotamuses as multifaceted, almost contradictory creatures. They were feared for their power and violence but also worshipped for
their protection and strength. Hippopotamuses were associated with Taweret, the nurturing goddess who protected women and children,
and Seth, the powerful god of disorder and violence.



"name: Ancient Art Nefertem,Egyptian"
Description: Nefertem was a god of renewal and the son of the creator god Ptah and his wife the lioness goddess Sakhmet. The triade Ptah, Sakhmet,
Nefertem were mainly worshipped in Memphis. The bronze figurine of the god Nefertem has a loop on its back between the head and the
crown. This indicates that the object, which is too large to be just an amulet, was used in rituals and probably carried on a chain around
the neck of a worshipper.



"name: Ancient Art Scarab with a Ram's Head,Egyptian"
Description: The ancient Egyptians believed that the dung beetle, the Scarabaeus sacer, was one of the manifestations of the sun god.
Representations of these beetles were used as amulets, and for ritual or administrative purposes. This ram headed scarab has bottom
design that combines divine images with the name of the Kushite King Shabaqo. The ensemble is organized on three levels: First a solar
barque with rudder; second a winged sun-disk, a raised cobra and a royal cartouche-separated by a vertical space divider from each
other-; and third a nb-basket in the lower round. The image divider protects the royal name from the power of the serpent, which faces the
cartouche. An oval double line with rope pattern frames the arrangement. The shape of the incised images and hieroglyphs is precise and
the inner structures very detailed, the oval frame and the wings of the sun-disk with diagonal, evenly and narrowly spaced hatch lines, the
shield of the cobra with a cross-line pattern and the nb-basket with a tightly packed, diagonal hatch line pattern; the layout is very well
organized. The back shows a beetle body, a ram head crowned with a sun disc and Uraeus-serpent. A collar of four rows with square
pattern covers the pronotum (dorsal plate of the prothorax). The elytron (wing cases) has incised borderlines, which ends at the rear in
spiral elements with lotus buds; quadruple line divides the wing cases. The design of the back is not standardized, the collar executed in
raised relief, and the head sculpted in the round; the incised lines and notches are thick and slightly irregular. The combination of beetle
body and ram head is excellently meshed by a greater space having been given to the ram head and collar in comparison to the elytron.
The carved, slender extremities have natural form, and deeply incised vertical hatch notches. The long-oval base is symmetrical. The
scarab is longitudinally pierced, was originally mounted or threaded, and functioned as an amulet. This amulet has a multilevel
connotation related to the god Amun-Re (scarab with ram head, Amun trigram, divine barque as cryptogram for Amun) combined with a
focus on the king Shabaqo, who was believed to be chosen as Amun's earthly representative. The amulet should secure the royal
authority (cartouche) of this king, as well as the divine support (ram head, solar barque) and protection (winged sun-disk, cobra) for the
king; it also could provide an elite owner with royal patronage and divine protection. The throne name Nfr-k3-Rc was also used by king
Ramesses IX of the late 20th Dynasty, but the iconography, layout, and style of the scarab make it more likely that the scarab was carved
for king Shabaqo. Ram headed scarabs were common since the New Kingdom, but became especially popular in the Kushite Period, the
25th Dynasty.



"name: Ancient Art Tray for a Serving Table,Islamic"
Description: This small tray is decorated with arabesques and with Arabic inscriptions that bestow good wishes- including good fortune, blessing,
wealth, joy, and happiness- on its owner.



"name: Islamic Art Thoth-Ibis,Egyptian"
Description: This tiny gold amulet in the shape of an Ibis holding a feather represents the god of wisdom, Thoth. The body was made of two pieces of
sheet gold worked over a core. Gold wire, used for the neck, was flattened out to form the head. The legs were made of gold wire, the
feathers and base of thin sheet gold. A loop for suspension was attached behind the neck.



"name: Ancient Art Ram,Egyptian"
Description: The ram was a sacred animal and manifestation of gods such as Amun and Khnum. This pendant is smoothly carved of lapis lazuli. It has
a round pierced projection on the back.



"name: Ancient Art Statue of Tef-ib,Egyptian"
Description: Tombs sometimes contained more than one statue representing the owner. The statues were usually inscribed with the owner's name
and titles, and they served as a focus for funerary rituals. These examples, belonging to a man named Tef-ib, are unusual in that they
represent the tomb owner while also bearing inscriptions referring to the four sons of Horus, who protected the internal organs of the
deceased. These deities were also identified with the north, south, east, and west, and the statues may have been placed in the tomb in
accordance with these directions. The differing facial features of these statues (including Walters 22.11, 22.12, 22.13) suggest that they
were made by more than one artist. Notice as well, the sizes of the four figures differ as well as their wigs.



"name: Ancient Art Lionness-headed Menat,Egyptian"
Description: This amulet represents a ""menat,"" a counterweight often made of metal worn on the back to keep large necklaces in place. ""Menats""
were regarded not only as jewelry but also as ritual objects sacred to the goddess Hathor, who was called, among many other titles,
""Mistress of the Counterweight."" This small-scale ""menat"" amulet shows the lion-headed goddess Sakhmet - closely associated with
Hathor - wearing the sun disk and a broad collar. Below appears an ""udjat,"" the eye of Horus, between two rearing cobras. The disk at
the bottom depicts another pair of snakes spreading large protective wings around a seated deity in the middle.



"name: Ancient Art Head and Torso of a Seated Man,Egyptian"
This statuette is carved in the round. It depicts a seated man with an inscription on his chest, right and left arms, and pilaster at the rear.



"name: Ancient Art Scarab with Royal Title and Name of Tjetet (?),Egyptian"
Description: This steatite scarab is glazed and inscribed on the bottom with the ""two royal aspects"" title and ""Tjetet,"" possibly a royal name. The top
has a medium high back and deeply incised details with almost regular line flow and good workmanship. The piece is simply made. The
""two royal aspects"" title does not contain a known royal name. Either one can interpret the ""Tjetet"" as a miswriting, or as an offering
table which can lead to a reading of ""Belonging to the offering table of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt."" This interpretation is most
likely, yet one should not neglect the possibility that ""Tjetet"" is the name of an unknown king. This scarab functioned as an amulet with
kingship connotations, and was originally mounted or threaded. It is possible that the amulet should assure the participation in the royal
rituals, especially in the food supply, and should also guarantee the supply for its private owner. The undercutting of the legs, the clear
partition of the plates by deep incised lines, and the single partition lines on the back are known for scarabs of the Third Intermediate
Period.



"name: Ancient Art Hawk's Head; Falcon's Head,Egyptian"
Description: This pendant together with the second piece (Walters 48.1656) was part of a pair which were as end pieces of a double necklace. The
sun disk on the falcon head identifies the represented god as Re.



",Ancient Art "Standing Man, Tjaty"name: Egyptian"
Description: This sculpture of a man is probably shop work. The man has his hands at his sides. There is an inscription on the front of his dress, and
on a stele at back. The piece is broken at the ankles.



"name: Ancient Art Man with Calf and Dog,Egyptian"
Description: This Old Kingdom relief fragment has suffered severe damage from salt since its original carving. This has caused pitting over many areas
of the piece, especially on the foot of the man, the calf, and the dog. The preserved carving is in fine, raised relief, including such small
details as the hair at the tip of the calf's tail and the 'elbow' on each of the dog's legs. The block was originally painted, and traces of red
pigment still remains in some areas. There are two separate scenes actually depicted, easily distinguished by the different scales of the
figures. On the left is a man at small scale who bends over a calf, pushing at the rear with one hand while pulling on the rope tied around
it's neck with the other. A single man doing this is uncommon, and the sharp angle at which the servant bends in order to simultaneously
lead and push the calf from behind is also unusual. The man has short hair and wears a short, fitted kilt with a large tie at the waist. This
type of kilt is first seen in the 4th Dynasty, but continues into the 6th Dynasty. The musculature of the man's biceps is paralleled in tombs
of both the 4th and 5th Dynasty, such as the tomb of Nofer at Giza and that of Sekhem-ankh-ptah at Saqqara. Above the calf is an
inscription which reads ""Bringing the calf"" (jn.t bhz). Facing the man and calf is a dog, identifiable by his ""long narrow muzzle, nearly
straight facial profile, slender body, long neck and limbs"" (Brewer, 116) as a greyhound, with a rope collar and curled tail. The dog stands
at his master's feet, to whose scale he is carved. The tomb owner's staff crosses the body of the dog, as does his left foot. Above the dog
is his name, Beha (bh3) possibly an abbreviation of ""behkai"" (oryx antelope), a dog's name known from other contexts. Beginning in the
5th Dynasty, dogs are commonly placed in hunting scenes, in the fields, or under the deceased's chair. However, a very similar scene to
this one, in which the tomb owner stands with his dog at his feet, can be found at Giza in the tomb of Ha-ef-Ra-ankh from the middle or
late 5th Dynasty. The type of the dog, as well as his collar are so similar that it is likely that the relief comes from this tomb or was made
by the same craftsmen team in a tomb nearby. The dual composition of the relief fragment suggests it is part of a larger wall scene in
which various servants of the tomb owner's estate bring and present the products and wealth of his holdings to him. During the Old
Kingdom these types of scenes were generally placed on the east and west walls of a tomb. The thick border which forms the left edge
and base of the scene might imply that it was located either next to a door or as part of a long wall with multiple false doors and/or
multiple scenes. The tomb from which the fragment originated must be located at Giza, and dates to the middle or late 5th Dynasty based
on relief and composition.



"name: Ancient Art Incense Burner,Islamic"
Description: This engraved and inlaid incense burner with a pierced top is decorated with birds on an arabesque background.



"name: Islamic Art Bust of a Man,Egyptian"
Description: The end of the 25th Dynasty and the beginning of the 26th was a time of stylistic experimentation. Sculptors revived traditional forms,
with modifications, and also created innovative decorations. The application to the chest of incised figures of the god Osiris lasted only
until the end of the reign of King Psamtik I (610 BCE).



"name: Ancient Art Bowl,Islamic,,Islamic Art Rectangular Tablet with Temple Scene,Egyptian"
Description: This low relief tablet is carved with papyrus columns at each side. It has Isis and Ptah on the left and on the right, a king presents offerings
to an Apis bull. Over the bull lis the sacred eye of Horus. In front of the king is Maat with the feather of truth in her hair. The piece has
been repaired.



"name: Ancient Art Conjoined Jars,Egyptian"
Description: Multivessel ensembles are documented in ancient Egypt during all periods, but they are particularly abundant in the New Kingdom and
Late Period contexts. Each of these conjoined vessels has a squat conical form tapering upward, a flat bottom, and a protruding lip. The
vessels are joined at their lower halves; traces of breakage on the side opposite the inscriptions indicate that they may have been part of
an ensemble of four of more vessels. Inscriptions of dark blue faience paste are inset on the front of the vessels. Each inscription is
composed in three columns in a rectangular frame containing the throne and birth name of Sety I: ""Men-Maat-Re; Sety, beloved of Re,""
as well as the epithets ""beloved of Maat,"" who is named ""Daughter of Re"" on the right vessel and ""Mistress of the Two Lands"" on the
left vessel. A line below each frame gives the name and titles of the owner of the ensemble ""Paser,"" the title mentioned on the right is
""priest of Maat"" and on the left, ""governor of the city and vizier.""

"name: Islamic Art Pataikos,Egyptian"
Description: This pendant shows Pataikos standing with hands on his hips. There is a loop on the back for suspension.



"name: Ancient Art Statue of Nephthys,Egyptian"
Description: In an ancient myth, Osiris was murdered by his evil brother Seth and mourned by his wife Isis and her sister Nephthys. Isis restored
Osiris's body, and he became a symbol of resurrection. Nephthys participated in the resurrection of Osiris and became associated
generally with the protection of the dead. She is shown here kneeling, her arm raised in a gesture of mourning. The emblem on her head
(now partially missing) consisted of the hieroglyphs for her name, meaning ""Lady of the Mansion.""
Description: 

"name: Ancient Art Figure of the Apis Bull,Egyptian"
Description: The Apis bull was associated with the creator god Ptah and with the rituals for the king. His main place of worship was Memphis. After the
death of the Apis bull he was mummified and buried in a special cemetery. Figures of Apis bulls were donated during the Late Period and
Ptolemaic period into temples. This bronze figure displays the bull on a base. He has a sun-disk between his horns combined with a
uraeus (cobra serpent). The carving on its body displays a collar, a winged sun-disk on the shoulders, and a cloth with a hatched pattern
on the back.



"name: Ancient Art Situla with Procession of Divinities and Worshippers,Egyptian"
Description: Situlae were vessels used to pour offerings of milk or water in purification rituals. They take the form of a human breast and were
associated with the goddess Isis. Incense burners were also used extensively in temple and funerary ceremonies. Incense, considered a
purifying element, was offered to honor the gods, kings, and the dead. This situla is decorated in raised relief. The central frieze depicts a
series of striding deities and worshipers. The base features a lotus petal motif, a symbol of rebirth.



"name: Ancient Art Statue of a Standard Bearer: Hor-nakht,Egyptian"
Description: Shown in the elaborate wig and gown of a New Kingdom courtier, Hor-nakht is depicted as a participant in a temple procession, carrying
the standard of a ram-headed deity, perhaps Amen-re, in his left hand. The presence of an ""ankh,"" or life sign, in his right hand is
unusual for a statue that does not represent either a king or a god. In this case, it may be an item used in temple ceremonies. The statue's
inscriptions request benefits for Hor-nakht from the gods Amen-re and Osiris, including life, prosperity, and health.



"name: Ancient Art Harpokrates (Horus the Child),Egyptian"
Description: Harpocrates or ""Horus the Child"" was the son of Isis and Osiris. He represents legal kingship as mythical successor of his father Osiris,
who, in death, became Lord of the Netherworld. He was especially popular in the Late Period and Ptolemaic period. Representations
such as this show him as a nude boy with his finger to his mouth, and a sidelock of hair, the symbols of childhood. Here he also has a
uraeus (a cobra serpent) above his forehead, symbolizing his entitlement to kingship.



"name: Ancient Art Pantheistic Bes,Egyptian"
Description: This dwarf-like, protective deity was very popular in ancient Egypt. Known from as early as the Middle Kingdom (ca. 2000 BCE), Bes was
venerated as a protector of the home, family, and childbirth, and for that reason figures prominently in domestic magic and amulets. His
close connection to all aspects of fertility and sexuality is demonstrated by the presence of his image in the ""Birth-houses""-shrines
associated with temples of the Late Period into the Roman era. He also had a special relation to the goddess Hathor and performed in her
retinue as a musician and dancer. Bes is represented here as a composite deity. He has the nude body of Horus the Child, two pairs of
wings and four arms (two stretched to the sides on top of the wings, and two hanging down in front of the body). His head has the typical
characteristics of Bes, with lion mane and ears, and a stylized beard. On the sides of his head additional animal heads are depicted. The
eyes of the figure were originally inlaid with gold, and his hands which are pierced, once held objects, perhaps swords.



"name: Ancient Art Ram-Headed Deity,Egyptian"
Description: The figure represents a male god with a human-shaped body, ram-shaped head, and wearing the atef crown (a combination of ram-horns,
plumes, the upper Egyptian crown, cobra serpents, and sun-disk). The figure likely represents the god Khnum.



"name: Ancient Art Saucer and Stand,Egyptian"
Description: A daisy decorates the interior of a tazza, or footed dish. A point on the bottom of the saucer fits into a corresponding depression in the
stand, securing the two together. Patterns cut into the still moist composition were filled with a different colored paste to create the inlay.



"name: Ancient Art Head from a Statuette of Amun,Egyptian"
Description: This piece is carved in the round, and depicts the head of Amun. His eyes are to be inlayed, and his beard is to be attached. He wears a
cap. There is a hole in the top for the insertion of a plume. At the back is a stele with an inscription.



"name: Ancient Art Ewer,Islamic"
Description: The artist of this ewer included his signature around the base of the vesselâ€™s neck. Yunus ibn (son of) Yusuf names himself al-
naqqash (artist or designer). He also claims the name al-Mawsili, meaning â€œfrom Mosul,â€​ thus connecting his identity and his work
with the city (in present-day Iraq), a famous metalworking center. Typical of ewers with inlaid decoration, several figural scenes are
situated around the body of the vessel. These scenes include depictions of hunters on horseback, musicians playing beneath a tree, and
an enthroned ruler.



"name: Islamic Art Head of a Priest,Egyptian"
Description: This priest has the aloof and self-satisfied expression found in the sculpture of this period.



"name: Ancient Art Seated Statue of Nehy,Egyptian"
Description: Depicted much as she would have appeared in life, the Chantress Nehy sits on a chair and holds in her left hand the symbol of her
profession, a sistrum or rattle used in the worship of the goddess Hathor. Judging from her fine clothing and elegant hairstyle, as well as
the scale and quality of her statue, we may assume that Nehy was able to afford a fine burial to ensure her place in the afterlife. Most
likely this statue, one of two known, graced a tomb at Saqqara, the ancient necropolis of Memphis.



"name: Ancient Art Scarab with Name of Sa-nebet-Junet,Egyptian"
Description: This scarab is inscribed on the flat underside with vertically arranged column writing. The inscription identifies an individual, Sa-nebet-
Junet and makes a statement of the individual's social status. The top is incised with a very detailed, deeply incised design with regular
line flow. The workmanship is slightly rough and the piece is not very carefully made. The scarab functioned as a private name seal and
as a user-individualized amulet. It wsa originally mounted or threaded. Teh amulet should assure constancy of individual existence and
social status, as well as renewal. The combination of frame lines with 'C'-shaped elements is less common than 'S' and 'Z'-shaped spiral
scroll enclosures.



"name: Ancient Art Scarab Amulet,Egyptian"
Description: The ancient Egyptians believed that the dung beetle, the Scarabaeus sacer, was one of the manifestations of the sun god.
Representations of these beetles were used as amulets, and for ritual or administrative purposes. The bottom of this scarab displays a
short, vertical inscription in an oval frame, which refers to the appearance of the sun god. It is enclosed by eight elongated, Z-shaped,
interlocked spiral scroll elements. The numerical arrangement of the eight spiral scrolls is: 1+2x3+1 = 8. The bottom inscription and spiral
dÃ©cor is very precise and regularly incised, and the layout very well organized and symmetrically arranged. The highest point of the
back is the partition between pronotum (dorsal plate of the prothorax) and elytron (wing cases), which is also defined by two short side-
notches at shoulder height. As additional decoration run two deeply incised branches from the head to the middle of the elytron where
they cross each other and end in one lotus blossom. The trapezoidal head is flanked by rectangular eyes; the side plates are irregular
trapezoidal, and the clypeus (front plate) has five frontal serrations, and a central base notch. The raised, slender extremities have natural
form and vertical hatch lines for the tibial teeth and pilosity (hair). The long-oval base is symmetrically. The scarab is longitudinally
pierced, was originally mounted or threaded, and functioned as an amulet. It should secure the presence and renewal of the sun god, and
for a private owner his divine support and renewal (eight spiral scrolls). The head and the back design with branches secure the dating in
the 13th-15th dynasty.



"name: Ancient Art Scarab with Wish Formula,Egyptian"
Description: The ancient Egyptians believed that the dung beetle, the Scarabaeus sacer, was one of the manifestations of the sun god.
Representations of these beetles were used as amulets, and for ritual or administrative purposes. This scarab has a bottom inscription,
which is framed by an oval line. It is contains a wish formula, which focuses on the young recruits in the army group under the name of the
god Seth. The Seth-hieroglyph is the most dominant sign in the whole inscription. The hieroglyphs are executed in sunk relief; the layout
is not very well organized, and some hieroglyphs collide with the borderline, which is inconsistent and overlaps twice in the upper part.
The Seth-animal has an unusual, elongated shape and a very long snout; the ears are not Seth-like, but canine. Nevertheless, the typical
tail identifies the animal as Seth. The highest point of the flat back is the partition between pronotum (dorsal plate of the prothorax) and
elytron (wingcases). Pronotum and elytron have incised borderlines, single separation lines, and V-shaped marks for humeral callosities
(shoulder thickenings). The semicircular head is flanked by quarter oval eyes; the side plates are irregularly trapezoidal, and clypeus has
four frontal serrations. The proportions of the top are well balanced. The raised, somewhat stocky extremities have natural form, and
three vertical hatch notches for the tibial teeth. The background between the legs is hollowed out. The shape of the base is symmetrically
round-oval. The scarab is longitudinally pierced, was originally mounted or threaded, and served as an amulet with a special blessing for
young soldiers. The scarab should secure the support and protection of the powerful god Seth for the young recruits of the army. It is also
possible that the phrase was used as a name for a military group of recruits. Seth and his powerful protection became popular during the
Ramesside Period, and it is understandable that especially the young recruits of the army needed his special protection.

sculptures. As is often the case, this statue has carefully indicated fingernails and toenails. There is a diadem running all over this
statuette's wig from the middle. The wig seems to be attached to the body as well as the arms. The woman has armlets and anklets
painted in green color with black lines. It seems that the wooden body was painted. Some white colors remain on the fingers. She is
dressed in the traditional linen sheath with shoulder straps. Hair in pigtails ending in short curls bound with band at ear level, hanging
beside neck and down back. Her wig was made by securing human hair to a mesh foundation by means of beeswax and resin. The large
wig covers the ears, the brownish color maybe was due to the fading black color that was before. The legs are side by side. Her arms are
at her sides. Her hands are extended flat. Her feet are glued to the block base. Her eyelid is not fully extended to the end of face, as well
as the thick eyebrows. The black canthus is wide. She has a round face and a long neck. She is wearing a necklace with large central

images and text signs are lopsided. The workmanship is slightly rough and the piece is not very carefully made. This piece functioned as

authority for the king, as well as divine protection and the special support of Amun. It should provide a private owner with this king's
patronage and protection. Double sided decorated oval plaques are typical for the 18th Dynasty, especiallay the reign of Thutmosis III-

amulet, and was originally mounted or threaded. The amulet should ensure for its owner support by the royal authority of the divine king
(Thutmosis III), as well as divine protection. The scarab was produced after the death of Thutmosis III (1479-1425 BCE). The names and
titles of Thutmosis III were used also in later periods; the Egyptians saw him as a protective god of kinship and his names and titles as
powerful magical elements. The additional reading of his throne name as Amun increased the power of this amulet.

upon a low base and holds her right hand in front of her face in a gesture of mourning. She wears a long sheath gown and a tripartite wig.
Her characteristic headdress is actually a hieroglyphic writing of her name: a ""nb"" basket on top of a ""hwt"" shrine/mansion. Her name
means ""Lady of the Mansion."" Numerous funerary amulets were usually placed among the many layers of linen strips used to wrap
mummies. Specific amulets, along with their required position on the body, are listed in funerary texts such as ""The Book of the Dead.""
Amulets were sometimes sewn directly onto the wrappings or could be incorporated into a bead net shroud covering the mummy. This
amulet has been modeled with a flat underside and is pierced by tiny holes around the edges for attachment.



"name: Ancient Art Mausoleum Doors,Iranian-Islamic"
Description: These doors originally opened into the mausoleum, or tomb, of Imamzada Sulayman, the son of a spiritual leader in Iran, where the Shia

and includes inscriptions in praise of â€˜Ali, cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad, and who, according to Shia Islam, was the rightful
successor to the Prophet. Panels with radiating star designs evoke the eternal heavens. Anyone passing through these doors would have
understood the decoration as a symbol of paradise, the hereafter to which all devout Muslims aspire. The maker's full name, carved in the
lower right panel, indicates that he was the son of a carpenter and confirms that crafts such as woodcarving were practiced by
generations within the same family.

Description: This scaraboid faience amulet is inscribed on the bottom with the name and title of the divine consort Shepenwepet. The top is carved
with the three-dimensional representation of a cat facing the right with the head turned to the front. The workmanship is a little rough, but
detailed. This piece functioned as an individualized amulet of the Divine Consort Shepenwepet II, and was originally mounted or threaded.
The image of a cat with kittens conveys the idea of fertility, renewal, and protection, and the name of Shepenwepet the individualization.
The amulet should secure the divine status, royal authority of the ""Divine Consort,"" as well as her presence and renewal. It is possible
that the amulet was created for the personal use of Shepenwepet, but it is also likely that it was given to a private person to guarantee her
patronage. The identification of the lying animal as a cat is possible by posture, content and comparision, but the round shapes of the
ears are a litttle uncommon and seem more canine. Nevertheless, the attitude of the animal, and the context make identification as cat
most likely.

"name: Ancient Art Deity or Genius of the Eastern Provinces,Egyptian"
Description: Many religions were syncretistic, meaning that as they grew and came into contact with other religions, they adopted new beliefs and
modified their practices to reflect their changing environment. Both Greek and Roman religious beliefs were deeply influenced by the so-
called mystery religions of the East, including the Egyptian cult of Isis, which revealed beliefs and practices to the initiated that remained
unexplained, or mysterious, to the uninitiated. Most popular Roman cults had associations with these mystery religions and included the
prospect of an afterlife. Although this figure was found in Egypt, the elaborate costume and headdress are similar to images from
southeastern Anatolia and Armenia. Female figures in the same costume appeared as personifications of Asia and Armenia on
monuments in Rome, suggesting that the boy represents the genius, or spirit, of one of these eastern provinces.

"name: Manuscripts Horus Stele,Egyptian"
Description: The Horus stele, or ""cippus,"" was one of the most important items associated with magic in ancient Egypt. At the center of these stone
slabs was the nude figure of the child Horus, or Harpocrates, associated with the newborn sun, with the head of the god Bes above him.
Horus-the-Child, the son of Isis, stands on two crocodiles and holds dangerous animals (snakes, scorpion, lion, and antelopes) in his
hands, demonstrating that with supernatural powers even a child can overcome dangers. Texts and magical scenes occupy most of the
empty space. Larger examples of these Horus stelae were placed in temple precincts, where priests poured water over them to absorb
the magical power of the spells and images. Drinking the water, it was believed, would protect against the harmful bites of dangerous
creatures as well as other dangers and evils. Smaller versions were used at home, and very small ones were worn as amulets.

Description: This (restrung) necklace consists of biconical carnelian beads, beads of rolled strips of sheet gold, and ten amulets. The rooster and

amulet of carnelian. The other amulets are cut out of sheet gold of varying thickness and have rolled sheet gold loops attached to the
back. Below the couchant animal at right is an amulet showing a man holding palm branches, which symbolized ""millions of years."" The
six remaining figures are hieroglyphs as well. The three birds at left probably represent the sacred ibis of the god Thoth although the long
body of one and thick bill of another seem more appropriate to ducks. Two amulets show the double crown resting on a basket, which
signified royal power in Upper and Lower Egypt. Another basket amulet has something protruding from it.

"name: Manuscripts Horus Stele,Egyptian"
Description: The Horus stele, or cippus, was one of the most important items associated with magic in ancient Egypt. At the center of these stone
slabs was the nude figure of the child Horus, or Harpocrates, associated with the newborn sun, with the head of the god Bes above him.
Horus-the-Child, the son of Isis, stands on two crocodiles and holds dangerous animals (snake, scorpion, lion, and antelopes) in his
hands, demonstrating that with supernatural powers even a child can overcome dangers. Texts and magical scenes occupy most of the
empty space. Larger examples of these Horus-steles were placed in temple precincts, where priests poured water over them to absorb
the magical power of the spells and images. Drinking the water, it was believed, would protect against the harmful bites of dangerous
creatures as well as other dangers and evils. Smaller versions were used at home, and very small ones were worn as amulets.

Description: During the Old Kingdom, the tombs of courtiers and officials were usually placed near the pyramid complex of their monarch. These
tombs, called ""mastabas,"" typically contained one or more statues representing the deceased official, members of his family, and
perhaps his servants. Meant as dwellings for the spirit of the individual, such sculptural representations ensured a continued existence in
the afterlife. This small non-royal head of dark, anorthosite gneiss is executed with great skill. The round face is emphasized by a round
wig whose bands of curls radiate from a spot on the top of the head. The almond shaped eyes bulge slightly and are set under a natural
brow line. The nose is straight with a slight bulb on the end of the nose. The philtrum is indicated above the full lips. The chin has a
prominent bulge. The remains of the shoulders indicate that the neck of the statue was not long. The facial features are slightly
asymmetrical, a feature prevalent in the Old Kingdom.

elephants on the bank of a river in a rocky landscape with a fortified city in the background. It appears that the wild elephants are being

"name: Manuscripts Male Figure Standing,Egyptian"
Description: Statues such as these were placed inside the tomb, sometimes adjacent to the coffin, to provide an additional home for the ""ka"" of the
deceased individual to reside in. This statue represents a man, who wears a short pleated kilt and a short wig made up of rows of
rectangles. His left leg is advanced, his right arm is at his side, and his right hand is clenched and pierced. His left arm is positioned
forward, joined at the elbow, with his left hand pierced and holding a fragment of a dowel. His hair consists of tile-like curls arranged
radially, leaving his neck and ears uncovered. He wears a short vertically pleated kilt, with a belt positioned below his navel. According to
Steindorff, it is possible that a middle piece was originally fastened above and in front by means of wooden nails or pegs. The toes are
deeply carved, and both the toenails and fingernails are carefully worked and articulated. The ears are carved, the nostrils are drilled, the
eyes are painted, and the nipples are inlaid with small nails. The body was painted red to indicate the tanned skin color of a male.
Despite excellent overall workmanship, the piece displays some unusual proportions: this statue has a long nose, big ears, a large upper
body and head, and a small waist. His hair is painted black, his eyes black and white, his body red, his kilt white, and the base stands
upon is black. The left upper arm, the left lower arm, the right arm, the legs (below kilt), and the fronts of both feet were all made
separately and attached to the body. The pegs in the rectangular base go through the prongs attached to the feet and anchor the statue
to it. The bottom right edge of the base appears to be missing, but it may have been intentionally carved that way (as it does appear
finished). It may have been carved that way to give the pegs access (it still has three peg holes and one peg preserved), and it may have
also served to attach it to another base on its right, possibly a larger base, in order to form a group statue. There are vertical cracks in the
statue's right hip and back. There are also cracks in the base, which has also been repaired (a split in the top of the base has been filled
in with a plaster-like substance). There is overall loss of pigment from the surfaces of the statue and the base.

"name: Manuscripts Relief Displaying the King Suckled by the Hathor-Cow,Egyptian"
Description: Pharaohs from Nubia ruled Egypt during the 25th dynasty (747â€“656 BCE), but this image predates that period by hundreds of years.
Instead of race, the black color of the kingâ€™s skin may indicate that he is deceased. In Egyptian royal art, black or green flesh is
associated with Osiris, the god of the underworld, but also with fertility and rebirth. The Egyptians called the lands around the Nile, with
very dark, rich soil fertilized by annual floods, the â€œBlack Landâ€​ (Kemet) in contrast to the â€œRed Landâ€​ (Deshret) of the deserts.

and both face with their open parts to the left. The design of the back of the scarab is detailed with fine incised lines, regular line flow, and
almost balanced proportions. The workmanship of the scarab is slightly rough and the piece is simply made. The scarab functioned as an
amulet with a regenerative connotation and was originally mounted or threaded. The bottom design was executed after the repair of the
scarab. The height of the scarab makes it likely that it was originally created as inlay for a finger ring. Later the scarab was reused, and
the second latitudinal hole was drilled.

"name: Manuscripts Ushabti of Ah-mose,Egyptian"
Description: Ushabti (meaning ""answerers""), also called ""shawabti,"" which resemble miniature mummies, were made of different materials such as
wood or Egyptian faience (ceramic-like material). These funerary statuettes represent the individual whom they accompanied into the
tomb and the afterlife. If a god called on the deceased to perform labor in the afterlife, this servant substitute, magically invoked by a
traditional spell, would answer and do the work on behalf of the tomb's owner. This ushabti figure displays its owner with a long wig and a
divine chin beard with a plaited pattern and curved lower end. He holds hoes for field work in his hands and has a back pillar. The
inscription, which contains the ""Ushabti-formula"" from the sixth chapter of the ""Book of the Dead,"" is laid out in nine rows below his
arms.



"name: Ancient Art Pendant with Image of Sarapis,Egyptian"
Description: The god Sarapis emerged in Egypt at the beginning of the Hellenistic era, when the country was occupied by Alexander the Great (332
BC) and a dynasty of Macedonian kings, the Ptolemies, ruled Egypt. It was Ptolemy I (305/304-282 BC) who gave the order to develop a
new religious cult for his dynasty and the Egyptian state, and he dedicated the first temple to Sarapis at Alexandria for this purpose. For
the Greeks, the creation of a new god was something extraordinary, but for the Egyptians the modification of religious concepts to fit new
needs was a long-standing tradition. The priests chose the Egyptian god Osiris-Apis (named later also Osorapis), who was a protective
deity, a god of oracles, and lord of time and eternity. They modified his name to Sarapis, and gave his visual representation a Hellenistic
form, appropriating the shoulder-length hair and full beard of the Greek supreme deity Zeus; the ""kalathos""--a woven grain basket--with
which Sarapis is often crowned, symbolizes fertility. The participation of Egypt's Greek population in rituals for Sarapis and the Hellenized
Isis was an expression of their loyalty to the dynasty (native Egyptians clung to their traditional gods), but the worship of Sarapis did not
end with the extinction of the Ptolemies. To the contrary: the god became a universal deity in Roman times, venerated throughout the
Mediterranean.

1330. There are a few numbers inscribed on the page: 4500, 9, and 18.

folk tales, was allegedly a jokester at the court of the third Mughal Emperor Akbar (949 AH/AD 1542-1014 AH/AD 1605). The witticisms of

"name: Manuscripts Fragment in Sunk Relief of Male Fecundity Figure Bearing Offerings,Egyptian"
Description: These two (together with Walters 22.93) well-preserved painted relief sculptures originally belonged to a depiction of a procession of
gods, who represented the 42 nomes, or regions, of Egypt. They once decorated the lower part of the southeast wall of the First Hall,
containing eight columns, within a temple dedicated to the god Osiris, built at Abydos by Ramesses II. The lower portion of both figures
remains in place in the Ramesses temple, where they are exposed to the elements. The reliefs shown here, however, have retained their
vivid color. The deities bring offerings for the cult of Osiris in Ramesses' name. Their faces follow the portrait style of Ramesses II, with
oval eyes, slightly hollowed eyelids, a small mouth, and a prominent, beaked nose. Note the remains of the hieroglyph above each
figure's head, indicating that he or she is the personification of a region. The raised area of these nome-signs retains red pigment. A
portion of the abundant offerings the male deity bears is preserved. His blue skin associates him with the forces of creation. Original
pigments also include yellow on the female deity's face, blue on her wig, and light green on the plant stalks she holds in her right hand.

"name: Manuscripts Scarab with the Cartouche of Thutmosis III (1479-1425 BC),Egyptian"
This steatite scarab is inscribed with the throne name of Thutmosis III (1479-1425 BC) in sunk relief technique on the flat underside. The
top of the scarab is high and has a simple carved design. The workmanship is slightly rough, and some of the details are out of shape.
The piece functioned as an individualized amulet and was originally mounted or threaded. The amulet should ensure royal protection and
support its owner, and make him as successful in warding against dangers as the king. The scarab was produced after the death of
Thutmosis III, who was most probably understood as a protective god and successful model of divine kingship. The combination of
different royal manifestations with protective renewal and good luck elements intends to assure the all-inclusive magic power of the
amulet. The body and posture of the animal figure in the lower round of the scarab is similar to a donkey, but the long horns, which are
too long to be ears, make it more likely that it represents the royal bull. Images of bulls on scarabs are mostly part of a motif showing the
animal trampling on an enemy.

human-shaped body with long wig and uraeus above the forehead, together with a moon-disk and crescent, represents the moon god Iah.
The ibis head refers to Thoth, the Atef-crown with the feathers stands for the god of the netherworld, Osiris, and the ram horns represent
Amun. Because the disk can be interpreted as moon or sun-disk, it is likely that in combination with the ram horns the solar aspect of
Amun, or Amun-Re, is intended. All of these different elements express the idea of the renewal of moon and sun, and therefore also of
the donor of such a figure in his afterlife.

had renewal connotations. The very high back of the scarab and its size makes it likely that it was produced as an inlay for a finger ring or
as a small pectoral.

"name: Manuscripts Statue of Tef-ib,Egyptian"
Description: Tombs sometimes contained more than one statue representing the owner. The statues were usually inscribed with the owner's name
and titles, and they served as a focus for funerary rituals. These examples, belonging to a man named Tef-ib, are unusual in that they
represent the tomb owner while also bearing inscriptions referring to the four sons of Horus, who protected the internal organs of the
deceased. These deities were also identified with the north, south, east, and west, and the statues may have been placed in the tomb in
accordance with these directions. The differing facial features of these statues (including Walters 22.10, 22.12, 22.13) suggest that they
were made by more than one artist. Notice as well, the sizes of the four figures differ as well as their wigs.

"name: Manuscripts Cylinder Seal with Offering Scene and Hieroglyphs,Egyptian"
Description: This seal depicts a figure seated, arms extended, in front of an offering table topped with bread. Two quadrupeds, possibly dogs, stand
behind the figure. The seal is inscribed with early hieroglyphic signs on either side of the figure. Some signs are identifiable but currently
not understandable, and they probably indicate the figureâ€™s uncertain name. This scene type with the deceased sitting at an offering
table is included in funerary stelae and on tomb walls throughout ancient Egyptian history. The seal is pierced lengthwise so as to be worn
as a personal ornament that acted as both a marker of status and a protective charm. This seal dates to the beginning of the Egyptian
state during the First Dynasty or the early Second Dynasty (ca. 2960-2649 BCE). Administrative cylinder seals also existed during this
early period, however based on the known provenance of many of these seal-typesâ€”non-royal tombsâ€”this sealâ€™s function was
most likely to help maintain the deceasedâ€™s funerary cult rather than to act as an administrative tool.

",Ancient Art "Triad of Isis, Nephthys, and Harpocrates"name: Egyptian"
Description: Pendants with representations of single gods or groups of deities were popular in the 1st millennium BC. This triad displays the juvenile
god Harpocrates in the center, depicted as a nude boy with a side-lock and uraeus-serpent above his forehead. To his right his mother
Isis is depicted and to his left is Nephthys. The two goddesses have the hieroglyphic signs which represent their names as crowns on
their heads; for Isis it is the throne, and for Nephthys the combination of a temple with a basket. The three figures are formed half in the
round; they have a rectangular backplate and base. The relationship between these three deities is an important part of the Osiris and
Horus myth. Both female goddesses protect the juvenile god of kingship, Horus, against the attacks of his powerful uncle Seth, the god of
the wild and uncontrolled nature, who tries to gain control of the universe. The small group is part of a set of nearly identical amulets
(together with Walters 48.1673, 48.1675-80). Such amulet groups were placed on the mummy between the wrappings.

favored the use of hard, dark stones and compact, block-like forms to insure the long-term survival of their statues. The texts on the front
of the kilt and on the sides of the seat request offerings and record Neferhotep's name and titles, as well as his parentage. The deity
invoked to secure the offerings is the deceased king who founded the Middle Kingdom, Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II (11th Dynasty).

shown wearing a double wig, a style fashionable in the New Kingdom. The statue type and wig demonstrate how 25th Dynasty artists
drew on earlier periods for inspiration. On the left side of the body is a carving of Irj-aa adoring the Osiris symbol of Abydos, the god's
burial place.

balanced proportions. The piece is simply made and the workmanship is good. This multifunctional amulet should provide royal and divine
support, good luck, life, renewal, and protection. The double presence of the six signs refers to the creation, and the single sun disc to the
creator. The amulet should protect and support its owner in all different situations. The piece was originally mounted or threaded. Scarabs
displaying hieroglyphic sign arrangements without syntactical context are typical for the late Middle Kingdom and the Hyksos Period.



"name: Ancient Art Vessel with Handles,Egyptian"
Description: In addition to its use in jewelry, amulets, inlays, and architectural decoration, glass was used for vessels, particularly distinctively shaped
perfume bottles. The two most common shapes take their names from Greek pottery: ""amphoriskoi"" (little amphoras) and ""krateriskoi""
(little kraters). This vessel is an example of the former, with its broad shoulders, rounded base, and opaque white ground. It is a core-
formed vessel; the technology of blown glass was as of yet unknown. The molten mass, composed of silica and natron (heated to a
temperature of around 1000Â°-1150Â° C) was wrapped around a clay or dung core that was later removed. Decorative bands were
formed by pressing threads of colored glass onto the molten surface; combing the threads with a metal tool created decorative patterns.

"name: Manuscripts Scarab with Wish Formula,Egyptian"
Description: This steatite scarab is inscribed on the flat underside in sunk relief. The vertically arranged column writing is a request to ensure the social
status of a member of an elite group. The design of the back of the scarab is very detailed, with deeply incised lines and slightly irregular
line flow. The piece is simply made and its workmanship is slightly rough. This scarab functioned as a status specific amulet with a
blessing for a member of the elite. The amulet should express/secure that the owner is notable, prestigious, and well equipped in the royal
court/palace. The piece would have originally been mounted or threaded. The term ""Golden Horus"" as the name of a god does not
appear before the Ptolemaic period, and it is very unlikely that this scarab dates from that period or that this deity would have been
mentioned so early.

",Manuscripts "Amuletic Figure of Kebehsenuef, Son of Horus"name: Egyptian"
Description: This faience amulet represents Kebehsenuef, the hawk-headed son of Horus. There are four sons of Horus and this amulet is part of a set
of four (Walters 48.1638-1641). The sons of Horus protected the vital organs of the body after mummification. The image is that of a
hawk-headed, mummiform human. The figure faces proper left. It is composed of blue glazed faience with the details picked out in
purple/black manganese. The figure wears a three row broad collar and a tripartite wig. There are five diagonal stripes of manganese
across the mummiform body representing the mummy wrappings or braces. A horizontal fracture separated the amulet about midway into
two fragments which have since been reattached. Numerous funerary amulets were usually placed among the many layers of linen strips
used to wrap mummies. Specific amulets, along with their required position on the body, are listed in funerary texts such as ""The Book of
the Dead."" Amulets were sometimes sewn directly onto the wrappings or could be incorporated into a bead net shroud covering the
mummy. These amulets have been modeled with a flat underside and are pierced by tiny holes around the edges for attachment.

"name: Manuscripts Scarab with Cartouche of King Sheshi,Egyptian"
Description: The ancient Egyptians believed that the dung beetle, the Scarabaeus sacer, was one of the manifestations of the sun god.
Representations of these beetles were used as amulets, and for ritual or administrative purposes. This scarab is a typical example of the
Second Intermediate Period. The bottom inscription contains the name and title of the King Sheshi, as well as a wish formula for his life.
The highest point of the back is the pronotum (dorsal plate of the protorax). Two side-notches at shoulder height define the partition
between pronotum and elytron (wing cases); these notches differ in shape and depth and are not aligned. The proportions of the top are
slightly unbalanced, and the pronotum is asymmetrical Two incised circular lines define the partition between body and the oval base.
The trapezoidal head is framed by borderlines and flanked by rectangular eyes. The trapezoidal side plates have curved outer edges, and
the clypeus (front plate) a central base notch. The scarab is longitudinally pierced, was originally mounted or threaded, and used as an
amulet. Such an amulet should on one side secure the existence and divine monarchy for this king, and on the other provide its private
owner with his royal patronage. There are many scarabs with the name of king Sheshi (e.g. Baltimore, Walters Art Museum, 42.17 and
42.26), which were found in Egypt, Nubia, and Palestine; nevertheless, there are no other monuments or historical records. It is likely that
the throne name of Sheshi was Maat-ib-Re, and scarabs with this name were similar popular and widespread. The identification of Sheshi
with a Hyksos rulers or one of the Hyksos vassals is likely, but not positive. Furthermore, it was several times considered to interpret the
name as a variant of the name of the Hyksos ruler Apepi.

"name: Manuscripts Seated Goddess Rayet-tawy (Rat-taoui),Egyptian"
Description: This is a seated limestone statue of the goddess Rayet-tawy. She was a female form of the sun god and was also goddess of the Two
Lands. There is some discoloration and pitting in the stone. There are several cracks and a major fissure divides the statue into two
fragments at mid-abdomen. The left arm is broken and a section from above the elbow to mid-forearm is missing. Her left hand is flat
upon her thigh and her right hand is clutched around an ankh sign. The goddess sits upon a seat with a rounded back and a shallow back
plinth extends from the top of the chair back to the bottom of her wig. She wears an ankle-length, strapless, sheath gown cut below the
breasts. Her tripartite wig is full on top of her head and comes down low over her forehead. The lappets are quite narrow. She is adorned
with a four-row broad collar and armbands and bracelets with alternating vertical and horizontal striations. She has a low modius crown
with a square opening in the top for the insertion of additional crown elements. Her Ptolemaic body shape includes a full, almost fleshy
abdomen and thighs and prominent breasts. She has an idealized face that archaizes to the Saite Period. Her most prominent feature is
her eyes. Her eyes have inlaid blue cosmetic lines and the eye itself is inlaid in white and black. Part of the upper cosmetic lines on the
right eye is gone and the right inlay eye appears to have been inserted into the socket upside down at some point.

"name: Ancient Art Cartonnage Mask of a High Official,Egyptian"
Description: The use of a cartonnage mask is one of the most characteristic features of ancient Egyptian burial customs. Such masks covered the
head and the upper part of the chest of a mummified person. Generally, they consist of layers of linen and gypsum that could be molded
to the shape of the deceased. Finally, each mask was painted in bright colors. Because of their fragility, relatively few cartonnage masks
of the Middle Kingdom have survived in as good a state of preservation as this one. The face is rendered in a formal, stylized way, giving
it a somewhat stiff expression. Even so, some details are indicated: the bristles of the full beard, the mustache, and the eyebrows, all
stippled in black over a blue ground. The man wears a voluminous wig with long, rounded ends, which are neatly rimmed with a
decorative border. A broad collar composed of many rows of beads features falcon-headed terminals, which are held in position by strings
emerging from under the wig on the mask's back. In addition, a simple necklace with a large pearl completes his adornment. But most
striking is the richly ornamented diadem with a floral motif over the forehead. The model for this diadem was gold and silver, inlaid with
semiprecious stones like carnelian, lapis lazuli, and turquoise. Although the original burial spot of the Walters' mask is not known, its
general style and details undoubtedly indicate that it came from the necropolis at Asyut. At this important site, the capital of the 13th
district of Upper Egypt, a French mission as well as the Egyptian nobleman Sayed Khashaba Pascha conducted intensive archaeological
excavations during the early 20th century. Many rock-cut tombs belonging to the courtiers of the Asyut nomarchs (the rulers of the nome)
were found untouched and still contained their original grave goods. This mask was probably discovered during the poorly documented
Khashaba excavation, which left no records about related objects found in the tomb, including the coffin of the deceased with its
inscriptions. Without records of his titles and name, the identity of the owner of this mask must remain a mystery.

Description: A faience, mold-made amulet in the form of a small plaque with the jackal god Anubis recumbent upon a pylon shaped chest/shrine. There
is a flail over the back of the jackal. The jackal and the chest are in raised relief. The jackal faces to the left, and this amulet is the mirror
image of Walters 48.1635. The glaze is a pale green except for the jackal which is bright blue. The lower and left sides are squared but
the other two are rounded, roughly outlining the shape of the jackal and the chest. Numerous funerary amulets were usually placed
among the many layers of linen strips used to wrap mummies. Specific amulets, along with their required position on the body, are listed
in funerary texts such as ""The Book of the Dead."" Amulets were sometimes sewn directly onto the wrappings or could be incorporated
into a bead net shroud covering the mummy. This amulet has been modeled with a flat underside and is pierced by tiny holes around the
edges for attachment.



",Ancient Art "Triad of Isis, Horus and Nephthys"name: Egyptian"

Thoth, Horus in double crown, Nephthys, Shu (god of the atmosphere), Nephthys, Horus with disk, Thoth, two plaques, Horus-the-Child
between Nephthys and Isis, and Khnum. The figures are pierced at shoulder height through a back pillar against which they stand. The
plaques have pierced flat bands protruding from them. Amulets such as these were an important part of funerary equipment and the
position in which some of them were laid on the mummy suggests that they were thought of as jewelry.

"name: Manuscripts Coffin of Rehu-er-djer-sen,Egyptian"
Description: This coffin, made for a man named Rehu-er-djer-sen, is an early form of burial container. The exterior was left largely unpainted, perhaps
because it was made from expensive, imported cedar wood. The interior is painted with brightly colored objects and offerings considered
essential to a wealthy burial. ""Coffin Texts,"" common to coffins of the early Middle Kingdom, were written on the wood to help the owner
gain access to the afterlife. The texts are a series of magical spells intended to safeguard the body and spirit of the deceased and ensure
resurrection. Deities were also depicted from the myth of Osiris that guaranteed protection. In the afterlife, the individual was to travel the

"name: Ancient Art Naturalistic Scarab with Hawk's Head,Egyptian"
Description: The ancient Egyptians believed that the dung beetle, the Scarabaeus sacer, was one of the manifestations of the sun god.
Representations of these beetles were used as amulets, and for ritual or administrative purposes. This scaraboid combines the type of a
naturalistic scarab with hawk head. The back of the scarab is flat, and the hawk head raised. The pronotum (dorsal plate of the prothorax)
and the elytron (wing cases) are separated by an incised partition line. The head of the hawk is modeled, and the round eyes were
originally inlaid. The extremities and belly are simply modeled and somewhat stocky. A central notch is at each edge. The body is detailed
executed for its small size, and the hawk head and beetle body join in a balanced way. The bottom is more roughly carved, the outer
shape is reminiscent of natural formed scarabs, the front with deep serration notches, but there are no extremities molded on the
underside. The basic form of the scaraboid is long-oval. The hawk-scaraboid has a regenerative connotation, and was most probably
attached to mummy wrappings. The hawk head of the amulet strengthens the solar renewal connotation of the amulet, and may focus on
the transition aspect.

does not necessarily mean that these artists drew the composition. Instead, their names may have been written by another person who
associated the subject and style of drawing with these two artists. The seal at the top of the page is dated AH 1126 (1714 CE). The
borders, populated with a variety of flowers and animals, may also date to the 18th century.

"name: Manuscripts Scarab of Hatshepsut,Egyptian"
Description: The ancient Egyptians believed that the dung beetle, the Scarabaeus sacer, was one of the manifestations of the sun god.
Representations of these beetles were used as amulets, and for ritual or administrative purposes. This scarab has a vertically arranged,
left reading bottom inscription framed by an oval line. It contains the name of the female pharaoh Hatshepsut, and an epithet expressing
her relation to the god Amun. The name of Amun is dominant by size and positioning in comparison to the royal name. The hieroglyphs
are well carved, but slightly irregular, and the forms and arrangement typical for the early 18th Dynasty. The highest point of the scarabs
back is the pronotum (dorsal plate of the protorax). Pronotum and elytron (wing cases) have single border and separation lines. V-shaped
shoulder marks represent the humeral callosities (shoulder thickenings). The rectangular head has a semicircular insert, and is flanked by
two-stage, quarter-spherical eyes. The trapezoidal side plates have curved outer edges and borderlines, and the clypeus (front plate) four
frontal serrations, and two central base notches. The extremities have natural form, and show vertical hatch lines on the upper side of the
fore- and midlegs for the tibial teeth, and pilosity (hair). The oval base is symmetrical. The scarab is longitudinally pierced, was originally
mounted or threaded, and used as an amulet. It should secure the special relation between Hatshepsut and the god Amun, and provide a
private owner with her royal patronage. There are many different variations of scarabs with the throne name of Hatshepsut and a variety
of different epithets; the epithet ""beloved of Amun"" was not only for her a very popular one.

This combination of the Menat and Usekh is surmounted by the heads of the divine couple Shu (god of the air) and Tefnut (goddess of
moisture and corrosive air). They were the first emanations of the primeval god Atum, when he created the world. The Menat is flanked by
cobra serpents; the upper part displays the squatting figure of the ram-headed sun god, while the lower part displays an oxyrhynchus fish
in a papyrus thicket.

"name: Ancient Art Scarab with Walking Lion Design,Egyptian"
Description: The ancient Egyptians believed that the dung beetle, the Scarabaeus sacer, was one of the manifestations of the sun god.
Representations of these beetles were used as amulets, and for ritual or administrative purposes This scarab displays on its bottom the
motif of a walking lion. The mouth of the animal is wide open and the tail raised upon its back. A sun disk appears below its head, an nb-
basket below its belly, a bush between its hindlegs, and further floral elements behind its body. The lion figure fills nearly the whole space;
only in front, between, and behind its extremities is some space to convey the environment. The figure of the lion has a short body, a large
head, and slim legs with very large paws. The size and round shape of these paws correspond to the form of the sun disk. The layout is
balanced and tightly packed, the figure of the lion and the other elements fill the whole space, and there is empty space only between the
frontlegs of the lion. The head of the lion is on the bottom of the head segment of the scarab. The highest point of the back is the
pronotum (dorsal plate of the prothorax). Two side-notches at shoulder height, which differ in depth and are not totally aligned, define the
partition between pronotum and elytron (wing cases). The triangular head has incised borderlines; the irregular side plates have side-
notches, and the four times serrated clypeus a short central base notch. The raise extremities have natural form, and diagonal hatch lines
for the tibial teeth and pilosity (hair); the background is deeply hollowed out. The oval base is symmetrical, and the drill-hole openings
framed. The scarab is longitudinally pierced, was originally mounted or threaded, and functioned as a protective amulet with royal
connotation. Particularly, it refers to divine royal power (lion) and solar presence (sun disc) as a life spending force (plants), and should
assure protection and renewal for its owner. There are several parallels for this motif on the bottom of scarabs. The type with an open
mouth is typical for examples from Palestine. Lion icons have royal and heavenly connotations, and the sub-icons specify or modify the
exact meaning.

lintel. Carved in very low relief, this piece depicts musicians and game-players before the deceased Ankh-ef-en-Sekhmet. The entire relief
has a plain border running around its perimeter. At the right is the deceased, seated and facing left. He sits upon a high-backed and
armed chair with cow's legs, which sits upon some type of mat. He holds a staff in his right hand, while his left hand rests on the arm of
the chair. In front of him is the upper part of a figure who places a lotus blossom in front of his face. Behind him are three groups of
performers, the first one a harpist and a flute-player, the second one a harpist and a double clarinet-player, and the third one consisting of
three singers; they are separated from each other by large vessels. In the lower row, is depicted a person who turns to grab the staff of
Ankh-ef-en-Sekhmet, followed by three pairs of game-players. The group farthest to the right consists of two pairs of people, playing the

missing between those two and the piece formerly in Seattle (upper right). There is a faint trace of red on the large figure's shoulder, not
quite large enough to establish that the whole was painted, though it is quite possible that it was.

dwarfism were believed, because of their unusual appearance, to have supernatural powers and a special relation to the gods. Figurines
depicting people with dwarfism were used as amulets and have been found in tombs as well as in ritual places. This male figure may have
been depicted as having characteristics of dwarfism. He has a large forehead, perforations for the eyes, and incised eye brows. The arms
and bowed legs are twisted. The stomach is distended and there is a ridge across the buttocks that may have originally connected the
figure to a seat.

"name: Ancient Art Family Group of Three,Egyptian"
Description: This piece is a Middle Kingdom limestone triad consisting of a central male figure flanked by two women. The central position of the male
figure illustrates his elevated status over the women. It is assumed that the people are all related but the exact relationships are uncertain
due to the incomplete state of the inscription. The statue is inscribed on the base with a brief standard offering formula and the names of
two of the individuals. All three figures have long arms and rather wide feet. They all share the same idealized facial features including
heavy hooded eyes and mouths that droop down at the corners. The brow lines are quite straight and the foreheads are broad. These
features echo the severity seen in royal portraiture of the time. The male figure wears a long wrapped garment which is tied at his waist.
He stands with his left foot forward and his arms hang straight with both hands flat upon the fronts of his thighs. His striated wig pushes
his large ears forward. Both women stand with their feet together and their hands rest flat against the sides of their thighs. They wear
ankle length sheath gowns cut below the breasts with two wide shoulder straps. Their tripartite wigs are plaited and gathered at the back
of the head. The wig lappets fall over the shoulders and curl outward at the ends in imitation of the wig worn by the goddess Hathor. The
front left corner of the base is missing. A major crack cuts diagonally across the feet of the figures. The surface of the base is slightly
raised beneath the feet of the male figure. Statue groups representing families, in various combinations or sequences, were a common
theme in ancient Egyptian art. Whereas in Old Kingdom statues the sizes of the individuals signaled their relative importance and their
relationship, Middle Kingdom statue groups are characterized by more naturalistic depictions. This sculpture is further characteristic of
Middle Kingdom group statuary with its back support, emphasized hands and feet, large ears, and heavy wigs.

incriptions on the front and sides. There is a deep crack from the head down. Kaha was one of two chief workmen at Deir el-Medina, the

"name: Manuscripts Head of a Priest,Egyptian"
Description: Presumably from a temple sculpture, this head represents an elderly man with individualized facial features. The statue to which it once
belonged was probably quite traditional in its pose and execution. This piece depicts a priest from the Ptolemaic Period. Statues of bald-
headed men of this type are known as ""egg-heads."" The head is slightly elongated and the cranial bone structure is often well defined.
The face is sensitively modeled and we are left with an image that evokes a real face, even if it is not a representation of any one
particular model. Features could be recombined to create a more realistic face, and we cannot assume that this piece is a true portrait of a
particular individual. The face is hollowed deeply beneath the eyes which are heavily lidded and appear to be partially closed even though
the eyeballs themselves bulge slightly. The bone structure around the temples has been carefully modeled. The ears are oversized but
they are pinned back flat to the sides of the head. The facial features are slightly asymmetrical, but this is not unusual for Egyptian
sculpture. The hollows beneath the eyes combined with the deep nasolabial furrows combine to make the flesh of the face appear to
droop and sag. The mouth, although turned down at the corners is very natural. Deep creases descend downward from the corners of the
mouth. The remains of a trapezoidal back pillar may be seen behind the head. There is a deep incised crease where the face meets the
neck. Part of the collar bone area is still visible above the jagged break. The surface of the piece is nicked and pitted and both ears have
suffered minor damage.

was worshiped in connection with royal coronations and funerary rituals. The image shows the bull crowned with a sun disk (associating
him with the sun-god Re) and the Uraeus, the sacred cobra (a symbol of kingship). He is also adorned with a collar around the neck and
an elaborate cloth on his back, two elements which are characteristic for the Apis bull.

lamp, rendered here in blue, is typical of traditional lighting fixtures in mosques and other religious buildings. It hangs over a low, X-
shaped book-stand intended to hold a copy of the Qur'an (the holy book of Islam). The lines of what look like Arabic writing above the
stand are not legible and probably were meant to imitate Qur'anic verses.

cultures across the world. Whatever the reason for doing so may be, the result is an object that purposefully recalls the past. The motifs
include men and women from the Safavid court, banquet and hunting scenes, animals in combat, and fantastic creatures. One of the
male figures in the lower left border of the right door is dressed in Portuguese clothing, reflecting Iranâ€™s contact with Europe in the
17th century.

four (Walters 48.1638-1641). The sons of Horus preotected the vital organs of the body after mummification. The image is that of a jackal-
headed, mummiform human. The figure faces proper left. It is composed of blue glazed faience with the details picked out in purple/black
manganese. The figure wears a three row broad collar and a tripartite wig. There are five diagonal stripes of manganese across the
mummiform body representing the mummy wrappings or braces. A horizontal fracture just below the buttocks separated the amulet into
two fragments which have since been reattached. Numerous funerary amulets were usually placed among the many layers of linen strips
used to wrap mummies. Specific amulets, along with their required position on the body, are listed in funerary texts such as ""The Book of
the Dead."" Amulets were sometimes sewn directly onto the wrappings or could be incorporated into a bead net shroud covering the
mummy. These amulets have been modeled with a flat underside and are pierced by tiny holes around the edges for attachment.

head, while his wife wears a long, narrow, strapless garment, and an elaborate wig surmounted with a cone of fat. He holds a lotus
blossom to his nose, while his wife places her hands on him in a loving gesture. On the opposite side of the table is a sem-priest holding
a closed ""Hst"" (water)-vase. Above these three people, in the curved portion of the stela, is a symmetrical image: two recumbent Anubis-
jakals (one has Inp-""Anubis"" written above his back), each sitting upon a shrine, facing each other. Between them is the hieroglyph for
""imnt""-meaning the ""West"" (i.e. the Necropolis). Behind each of the jackals is a ""wDAt""-eye, and above the left jackal is preserved a
""Sn"" hieroglyph (symbolizing protection) on top of a cup/basket hieroglyph. There are remnants of red and black pigment on the stela.
The stela was broken into two large fragments and the top right corner is broken off; large metal staples and plaster have been added.

"name: Manuscripts Scarab with a King Holding a Captive,Egyptian"
Description: The ancient Egyptians believed that the dung beetle, the Scarabaeus sacer, was one of the manifestations of the sun god.
Representations of these beetles were used as amulets, and for ritual or administrative purposes. The bottom of this scarab displays a
motif, which shows King Ramesses II smiting an enemy. The king grabs the captive with one hand by his hair, and swings back his sickle-
sword with the other. The vehemence of the movement is supported by his striding posture having the front foot on the ground, but the
heal of the back foot lifted. The captive's lower body faces to the right, his head and raised arms turned towards the king in a capitulation
gesture. Ramesses II wears a knee length kilt and the so-called ""Blue crown"" with Uraeus-serpent and long crown sash; a sun disc
flanked by two Uraei (cobras) is above his head. It is notable that the sword and the sun disk appear together in the top of the text field.
The captive is dressed in a calf length kilt and has a Nubian hairstyle. The lower round, below a horizontal scene divider, displays the
unification icon with papyrus and lotus plants combined with two kneeling, fettered captives: a Nubian (left) and a Libyan with a feather in
his hair (right). The inscription in front of the king contains his throne name, behind his back is an epithet, and between his legs an nb-
basket. The figure of the king dominates the upper register by its size and movement - conveying victorious power. The turned position of
the captive with raised arms, the slightly bent upper body, and the small step with one raised foot demonstrates insecurity. The
arrangement of the hieroglyphs, as well as the baseline with the unification icon below, creates a frame, which conveys a solar, earthly,
and royal dimension. The back of the scarab is flat, and pronotum (dorsal plate of the prothorax) its highest point. Pronotum and elytron
(wing cases) have double separation lines. The head section consists of a semicircular head flanked by quarter-spherical eyes,
trapezoidal side plates, and a four times serrated clypeus (front plate). The slender extremities have natural form, with some diagonal
hatch lines on the ends of the legs for the tibial teeth and pilosity (hair). The oval base is symmetrical. The scarab is longitudinally pierced,
was originally mounted or threaded, and functioned as an amulet. It should secure the presence and victorious power of the king, and
provides a private owner with his royal patronage and protection. The high quality of the piece makes it likely that it was produced and
used in the royal court. One can speculate if such scarabs were distributed to high officials, especially in the military. The motif of the
unification icon with fettered captives appears also on a scarab in the Pushkin Museum (no. 2338), displaying Ramesses II seated on a
Sed-festival throne or litter accompanied by Month and Seth; the name of Ramesses is also written without cartouche. It is likely that both
scarabs belong to a series.

"name: Ancient Art Lioness Game Piece,Egyptian"
Description: Ivory was used, from predynastic times forward, to create luxurious practical objects such as combs, hair pins, amulets, spoons, and knife
handles (Drenkhahn 1986). Around 3000-2900 BCE, a distinctive class of ivory objects--gaming pieces in the form of animals--emerged.
These small statuettes represent recumbent lions (both male and female) and hounds. The broad collar and absence of a mane indicate
that the subject of the piece illustrated here is a female lion; the rectangular pectoral on the figure's breast is the result of modern
recarving, and the high polish was not original to the figure. Such a figurine was probably used in the game of ""Mehen"" (""coiled one""),
played on a round board in the form of a coiled serpent with a trapeziodal projection. The game was popular until the end of the Old
Kingdom.

signature on the round incense burner or hand warmer begins with the Persian word naqsh, meaning ""decorated [by].""

"name: Manuscripts Naturalistic Scarab,Egyptian"
Description: The ancient Egyptians believed that the dung beetle, the Scarabaeus sacer, was one of the manifestations of the sun god.
Representations of these beetles were used as amulets, and for ritual or administrative purposes. Naturalistic scarabs, such as this, were
used as part of the amulet set of the mummy. They have a naturalistically formed belly and no additional inscriptions or motifs. The
highest point of the back of this scarab is the pronotum (dorsal plate of the prothorax). Pronotum and elytron (wing cases) are separated
by a straight, incised partition line; the wing cases have a vertical hatch line pattern (nine lines on each side), a central division line (which
ends V-shaped in a scutellum), and U-shaped shoulder marks. The proportions of the top are almost balanced, but the pronotum is short
in comparison to the elytron. The triangular head is flanked by very small, quarter-spherical eyes, which protrude from the head; the side
platesare irregularly trapezoidal and have hatch lines, and clypeus (front plate) is four times serrated. The detailed modeled extremities
are slender and have natural form; central notches are at both side edges as well as the top and bottom edges. The body structures of the
bottom is modeled, and a quarter-oval eye protrudes from the center of the belly. The basic form of the scarab is long rectangular-oval.
The scarab is a funerary amulet with regenerative function, and was attached to the mummy bandages.

"name: Manuscripts Coffin Panel with Paintings of Funerary Scenes,Egyptian"
Description: This panel is from a human-shaped coffin ensemble typically used for the priests of Amun at Thebes, who ruled there during the 21st
Dynasty. These wooden coffin groupings usually consisted of two nesting coffins with lids and a mummy board carved to resemble the
deceased and placed directly on top of the mummy. The panel is from the exterior right side of the inner container. During the 21st
Dynasty, both the interior and exterior of coffins were decorated with amuletic symbols, short texts, and small, highly colored scenes that
covered every inch of the surface. The owner of the coffin, not named on the panel, is depicted as a woman in one of the painted scenes.
By the 21st Dynasty, decorated chapels and tombs were no longer used. Instead, burials took place in unmarked rock-cut chambers,
probably to deter tomb robbers. Religious scenes that had once appeared on tomb walls were now painted on coffins and papyri. The
panel is divided into three zones. The upper zone displays uraeus serpents, symbolizing protection, and Maat feathers representing the
concepts of justice, truth, and divine order. The second zone contains a religious text, and the main zone below has different sections with
representations of Osiris as well as the sun god in their shrines and scared places. The union of the mythologies of Osiris and the solar
god Re is significant, as each set of beliefs, both concerned with resurrection and rebirth, was thought to benefit the deceased in their
journey through the underworld.

"name: Manuscripts Cat,Egyptian"
Description: Representations of cats are well-known in Ancient Egypt from the 2nd millennium BCE. The onomatopoetic Egyptian name was ""miu""
(mjw) for the male, and ""mit"" (mjjt) for the female cat. Egypt's economic base was agriculture and therefore rodent- and snake-hunting
felines were very much appreciated. In terms of religious beliefs the male cat was connected to the sun-god, and the female cat to Bastet.
Particularly in the Late Period and Ptolemaic period, representations of the goddess as well as cats and cats with kittens became very
popular to symbolize fertility and renewal. Amulets worn in daily life could also offer powerful protection in the afterlife. Women wore cat
amulets to place themselves under the patronage of Bastet, goddess of fertility and joy. The cat, noted for its fertility, was the deity's
sacred animal. This amulet presents an upright seated cat with an oval ornament in the middle of her chest. The ears are very large in
comparison to the head, and the eyes protrude. The amulet has a rectangular base and a loop behind the cat's neck.

"name: Manuscripts Scarab with Pseudo-text,Egyptian"
Description: The ancient Egyptians believed that the dung beetle, the Scarabaeus sacer, was one of the manifestations of the sun god.
Representations of these beetles were used as amulets, and for ritual or administrative purposes. The back of this large scarab has its
highest point at the elytron (wing cases). Partition and division lines of pronotum (dorsal plate of the prothorax) and elytron are covered
with a setting of golden bands. The rectangular head is flanked by semi-ovoid eyes; the side plates are trapezoidal with curved outer
edges, and the clypeus (front plate) is five times serrated. The raised, slender extremities have natural form, and the background between
the legs is hollowed out. The shape of the low base is symmetrically long-oval. The inscription on the bottom has seven lines of a left
reading text and seven horizontal text dividers; the inscription is framed by an oval line. The bottom inscription is executed in sunk relief or
linearly incised; the hieroglyphs are slim and elongated, some have inner structures, and some are slightly disproportional; the layout has
several irregularities, such as lopsided signs, or hoe-like pseudo-hieroglyphs, which collide with the outer border. The execution of back
and bottom differs: the back and sides are carefully formed, but the bottom inscription is very rough. The gold leaf and linen fragments are
randomly attached. The scarab is pierced lengthwise, what normally refers to an additional mount or support, but is unusual for a Heart
scarab of this large size. The scarab shows several discrepancies, which lead to the conclusion that it was produced in modern times.
Most probably it imitates a Heart scarab, which was made to be placed on the chest of a mummy. To give it a more ancient look, linen
fragments were attached, and to make it more precious, small pieces of gold foil added. The following discrepancies have to be
mentioned: - The text on the back is not a direct copy of an original Heart scarab and was created without adequate knowledge of ancient
Egyptian language and script; - the script style has no ancient Egyptian parallel; - the name of an owner is missing, and there is also not
enough empty space to add a name, as in unused, prefabricated Heart scarabs; - the gold bands on the back seem to be copied from
settings of hard stone scarabs, but without understanding of the function of the bands as a setting; - a longitudinal drill would be unusual
for a scarab of this size; - traces of the mummy wrappings would normally not adhere to the body of a glazed scarab and may have been
adapted from wooden pieces.

surmount a coffin and be placed in an animal cemetery, or could be donated to the Thoth temple. While ibis figures and mummies have
been found in many places in Egypt, baboon mummies are rarer, and most of them come from Tuna el-Gebel.

"name: Manuscripts Male Bust From a Group Statue,Egyptian"
Description: This fragment was once part of a double statue and would have probably shown the man seated with his wife to his left. His costume is
the same as that worn by the royal scribe Nahu, also shown here. The three stylized flesh folds on the official's upper abdomen were a
conventionalized method of showing relatively advanced age and prosperity. The remaining hieroglyphic text (on the back) mentions Ptah
and Sokar, gods associated with ancient Memphis, suggesting that this sculpture came from the official's tomb at Saqqara, which was the
primary necropolis, or cemetery, of Memphis.

"name: Manuscripts Scaraboid with Crouching Calf,Egyptian"
Description: The ancient Egyptians believed that the dung beetle, the Scarabaeus sacer, was one of the manifestations of the sun god.
Representations of these beetles were used as amulets, and for ritual or administrative purposes. Amulets with oval base and half-ovoid
back representing other animals are named scaraboids. This scaraboid displays the representation of a crouching calf. The calf is facing
to the right, the head as well as the tail raised and bent back to the center of the back. The figure fills the whole oval space; head, tail and
extremities are very close to the body giving a compact and balanced impression. The unusual height of the scaraboid conveys the idea
that the calf is crouching on top of a rock or pedestal. The base has a symmetrically long-oval shape. The bottom shows the figure of a
squatting divine child, which has the finger to the mouth, an ankh-sign (meaning ""life"") is in front of his face, a lotus plant with bud
hanging down above his knees, and an nb-basket below his body. The figure of the child is executed in sunk relief, the high, slim waist, as
well as the long neck and head make it likely that the piece was created in the Amarna or early Post-Amarna Period; the layout is well
organized, the figure of the child centered, and only the nb-basket is a little small. An oval line frames the arrangement. The calf-
scaraboid with divine child on the bottom has a renewal connotation. The calf represents the daily reborn youth (sun god) of the celestial
cow, and the child represents probably not only the solar child, but also the king Akhenaten.

",Ancient Art "Triad of Isis, Horus and Nephthys"name: Egyptian"
Description: While Egyptian jewelry was worn in daily life, most of the examples known today came from tombs, where they adorned mummies.
Amulets provided magical protection for the wearer in both life and death. The consistent color and workmanship of the 13 light-blue
faience figures of gods owned by the Walters (this one and Walters 48.1676, 48.1679, 48.1680, 48.1684, 48.1701, 48.1702, 48.1704,
48.1705, 48.1708, 48.1709, 48.1710 and 48.1711) suggest that they came from the same workshop. Represented here are Horus the
Child (Harpokrates) flanked by Isis and Nephthys.

"name: Ancient Art Inlay in the Form of a Jackal,Egyptian"
Description: Jackals were linked with the dead, most probably because they were present in the desert regions near to the cemeteries, where they
searched for bones. The most popular jackal-shaped god was Anubis, who was also depicted with a jackal's head on a human body. This
inlay depicts a black recumbent jackal with an attentively raised head. His eyes are made from white and black glass; a red collar adorns
his neck.



"name: Ancient Art Bahram Gur in the Green Pavilion,Islamic"
Description: This folio from Walters manuscript W.604 depicts Bahram Gur in the green pavilion.



"name: Manuscripts Aegis with the Head of Sekhmet,Egyptian"
Description: The collars worn by both Egyptian men and women were composed of two main parts: in front, a broad collar (called ""wesekh"")
decorated with floral elements, and a v-shaped counterpoise (called ""menat"") falling behind the neck to balance the weight of the collar.
Such a combination was not only used as decoration but also as a ritual instrument by holding the ""menat"" in the hand and rattling the
beads of the collar.

The three-dimensional depiction of ""wesekh"" and ""menat"" combined with a divine head became an important symbol. The head of a
feline goddess atop this model collar indicates that it is intended as a personification of her powers, conveying in its decoration the ability
of the lioness both to protect and to nourish the king. Her dual nature is evoked by her stern and watchful face on the front side, and by
her representation as a mother suckling a young prince on the reverse. This precious object may have been produced for someone of the
royal family.

"name: Ancient Art Statue of Tef-ib,Egyptian"
Description: Tombs sometimes contained more than one statue representing the owner. The statues were usually inscribed with the owner's name
and titles, and they served as a focus for funerary rituals. These examples, belonging to a man named Tef-ib, are unusual in that they
represent the tomb owner while also bearing inscriptions referring to the four sons of Horus, who protected the internal organs of the
deceased. These deities were also identified with the north, south, east, and west, and the statues may have been placed in the tomb in
accordance with these directions. The differing facial features of these statues (including Walters 22.10, 22.11, 22.12) suggest that they
were made by more than one artist. Notice as well, the sizes of the four figures differ as well as their wigs.



",Ancient Art "Scarab with a Deity, Offering Table, and Tree"name: Egyptian"
Description: This steatite scarab has a flat underside with vertically arranged, sunk relief design representing a hawk-headed deity combined with an
offering table and a tree. The back is high and is carved in a detailed, deeply incised design. The piece is simply made and the
workmanship is good. The scarab functioned as a provider-individualized amulet, and was originally mounted or threaded. The amulet
should secure the necessary rituals for the god, and provide its owner with his divine protection. It is possible that the owner of the scarab
was involved in the rituals, and had a priestly function. The combination of a divine figure with an offering table does not belong to the
standard repertoire.

",Manuscripts "Figure of Hapy, Son of Horus"name: Egyptian"
Description: During the process of mummification, amulets of different kinds were placed on the body or wrapped in the mummy bindings to protect
the deceased from the dangers of the underworld. Figures of the four ""Sons of Horus,"" the gods who protected the containers that held
the organs of the deceased, were an indispensable part of a complete set of amulets. This figure of the baboon-headed god Hapy, who

long folded cloth in each hand.



"name: Ancient Art Krateriskos,Egyptian"
Description: Although the manufacture of faience can be traced back to the predynastic period (the fourth millennium BCE), the production of true
glass did not emerge in Egypt until the early 18th Dynasty, around 1500 BCE. Recent excavations and technical analysis support the
hypothesis that the technology of glassmaking was imported from western Asia. Both raw glass, in the form of large ingots, and finished
vessels were likely imported at an early stage, as were the artisans themselves. Within a short time, however, the Egyptians had
developed a highly sophisticated industry that flourished under Amenhotep III (1390-1352 BCE) and his successor, Akhenaten (1352-
1336 BCE). Polychrome glass seems to have been particularly esteemed by the court; large numbers of vessels have been found in the
tombs of 18th Dynasty pharaohs. The contents of many glass flasks-fragrant essences dissolved in plant-based oils-confirm their status
as objects of high luxury. In addition to its use in jewelry, amulets, inlays, and architectural decoration, glass was used for vessels,
particularly distinctively shaped perfume bottles. The two most common shapes take their names from distinctive types of Greek pottery:
""amphoriskos"" (little amphora) and ""krateriskos"" (little krater). The Walters ""amphoriskos"" (Walters 47.31), broad shouldered with a
rounded base, has an opaque white ground; this ""krateriskos"" has a cobalt blue body decorated with white, yellow and light blue bands,
two horizontal handles, applied to the shoulder, and a wide foot. Both are core-formed vessels; the technology of blown glass was as yet
unknown. The molten mass, composed of silica and natron (heated to a temperature of around 1000Âº-1150Âº C), was wrapped around a
clay or dung core that was later removed. Decorative bands were formed by pressing threads of colored glass onto the molten surface;
combing the threads with a metal tool created decorative patterns.

",Ancient Art """Senet"" Game Piece"name: Egyptian"
Description: Egyptians enjoyed playing board games, especially ""senet,"" or ""passing."" From the Old Kingdom, the game also had religious

from inlaid dowels inserted into the body. In addition to being cut off at the level of the pectorals, this piece has suffered additional

side of his neck. Paint has also fallen off of the chest and face. There are extensive restorations, including the coloring (the face has been

two examples, the decoration consists of intertwined and composite creatures that seem to grow out of or attack one another. One such
menagerie, on the right-hand flask, includes a cheetah or lion chasing an antelope in the center, and bucks, antelopes, lions, birds, a
boar, elephant, and mongoose at the two ends. Many of these animals were regularly hunted (or used for hunts, as with the elephant), in
Mughal India.

"name: Manuscripts Standing Male Figure,Egyptian"
Description: For a short period during the late Old Kingdom and the 1st Intermediate Period, it was popular to show the tomb's owner without clothes.
These figures represent the deceased in the phase of renewal in front of the god Osiris, lord of the underworld. This tomb statue depicts a
standing nude male, with his left food advanced. His body is inclined slightly backward, perhaps to give the impression of striding. Both of
his arms are at his sides, and both of his hands are closed. This is possibly to indicate that he is holding something, but we cannot
discern exactly what it is, as whatever it is does not extend out of his hands on either side. His eyebrows are carved in relief, and there are
lines at the corners of his nose. He wears a short haircut, leaving his rather large ears uncovered. He has a very deeply carved belly
button, and his toes are carved so as to be completely separated from each other; his fingers are not carved as deeply. The rectangular
base that he stands on is original and carries the inscription which reads ""the sole companion Ha'a."" The body is painted red, the nipples
black, the hair black, the eyes black and white, and the base is painted black on the sides and red on its top. The front of the left foot, the
left arm, the right arm, and the body were all made separately, and were attached using dowels, as can be seen in the case of the right
leg. The arms are joined at the shoulders. The statue is anchored to the base by means of two wooden dowels, which go through the
base and through an invisible prong located under the right foot. In addition to extensive paint loss in numerous places on the surface of
this piece, this statue has also suffered structural damage. Cracks exist down the length of the base's top; a crack in the top of the back
end of the base is filled in, probably a modern repair. In addition, the top of the left foot, the right shoulder joint, and the back of the right
hand are damaged.



"name: Ancient Art Wall Fragment of Men with Bows,Egyptian"
Description: Walters 22.98 is a painted limestone fragment of wall relief from the Temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el Bahri. Three archers are at least
partially visible. Of the rear figure, only his left arm, with his hand clenched in a fist is visible crossing over the chest of the central figure.
All that is visible of the rear figure is part of his right shoulder and the upper section of his bow. The figures form a line with the left arm of
each man overlapping the right arm and chest of the man in front of him. The central figure stands with his face turned in profile toward
the right and it may be assumed that the others are posed in a similar manner. His bow and quiver of arrows are held in his right hand
and fall onto his right shoulder. He wears a short cap-like wig with rectangular plaits. His naturally shaped eye is wide open and overly
large and his tear duct appears to be cutting into his nose. His lips are sharply outlined and his nose is defined by a deep crease. The
flesh of the men is painted a dark reddish tone, however, a modern cleaning of this piece removed a significant portion of the pigment
from the chest of the central figure.

"name: Manuscripts Scarab with Bird and Papyrus,Egyptian"
Description: The ancient Egyptians believed that the dung beetle, the Scarabaeus sacer, was one of the manifestations of the sun god.
Representations of these beetles were used as amulets, and for ritual or administrative purposes. This scarab has a flat bottom with a
special design that combines of images and hieroglyphs. The layout of the deeply incised design is unusually organized, the hieroglyphs
face in different directions, and some collides with the borderline. The dominant icons are: a hawk with his outstretched wings, and a left
rotated pool with the flowers. An oval line frames the arrangement. It may be possible to interpret the sign combination as cryptographic
writing of the royal name Amenhotep. The highest point of the back of the scarab is the double partition line between pronotum (dorsal
plate of the protorax) and elytron (wing cases). Both parts have incised borderlines, and a double division line separates the wing cases;
the line flow is slightly irregular. The semi-oval head is flanked by triangular eyes; the triangular side plates have outer borderlines, and
the clypeus (front plate) is marked. The head section is very short, and the head itself small in comparison to the clypeus. The extremities
have natural form and diagonal hatch lines for tibial teeth and pilosity (hair). The oval base is asymmetrical shaped having slightly smaller
head part. The scarab is longitudinally pierced, was originally mounted or threaded, and used as an amulet. The design should secure the
close relation of this king to Amun, and provide a private owner with royal patronage of the current king. The are several arguments for
dating the scarab in the reign of Amenhotep I and not in a later period: The figure of the hawk with wide outstretched wings, which is
popular during the early Thutmoside Period, the round-oval shape of the base, as well as the clear and simple back design.

names of King Amasis. The central column reads ""The good-god, lord-of-the-two-lands, may he live eternally.

owner is clothed with a shroud and is shown with a blue beard. This boat was probably placed in the tomb to assist the deceased in
navigating the Nile of the underworld. Typically, models of passenger ships found in Middle Kingdom tombs occur in pairs. One to travel
south, equipped with a sail, as the wind in Egypt blows constantly from north to south, and the other (as this model shows) propelled by
rowers aided by the Nile's current, to travel north.

Description: A faience scarab amulet with a blue glaze. In some areas the glaze is worn and the matrix of the material is visible. The elements of the

5 cm long and most often are blue in color. An incised ridge along the lower side forms a narrow base. Numerous funerary amulets were
usually placed among the many layers of linen strips used to wrap mummies. Specific amulets, along with their required position on the
body, are listed in funerary texts such as ""The Book of the Dead."" Amulets were sometimes sewn directly onto the wrappings or could
be incorporated into a bead net shroud covering the mummy. These amulets have been modeled with a flat underside and are pierced by
tiny holes around the edges for attachment. The winged scarab is a potent symbol of resurrection and rebirth. The protective deities
represented are connected with the myth of Osiris.

excavated in Egyptian and Nubian tombs. Cornflower pendants are known in ancient Egypt from the New Kingdom, and although the
blossom of the real flower is blue, the Egyptian jewelry makers created them from all different kinds of materials and in different colors.
Cornflowers were not endemic in Egypt, and most probably brought under king Thutmose III from Syria to Egypt. Immediately they
became popular, and appear in flower bouquets, floral mummy ornamentations, and they were also regenerative symbols in any kind of
daily and afterlife ornaments. Fly pendants are known in ancient Egypt from Predynastic times through the late New Kingdom. They had
an amuletic function, and were probably thought to frighten away not only real flies, mosquito, and other insects, but also different kinds
of evil, including enemies. Therefore, a necklace of large golden flies was one of the most desired gifts of honor, which high ranking
military persons could receive from the king. The smaller version of golden flies, were used by men and women as protective jewelry, and
were also placed in tombs for the deceased.

a good life for the deceased in the Netherworld. This small strip of fabric is woven of high-quality linen and belongs to the well-known
object group of inscribed mummification bandages. The originally light beige linen is now discolored to a darker brown. Both side ends of

"name: Manuscripts Qur'an Board,Islamic"
Description: From an early age, Muslims are encouraged to memorize the Qur'an. By adulthood, many can recite long passages, if not the entire text.
In Qur'anic schools across northern Africa, students commit verses of the Qur'an to memory by writing them on Qur'an boards, or
""lawh."" Faint traces of words are still visible on this example. Once a verse was memorized, the board was washed off with water, and
the student could start afresh. The water was treated with great reverence, for it was believed to contain the words of God and at times
was used to ward off illnesses.

"name: South and Southeast Asian Art Qur'an,Islamic"
Description: Fluid letters undulate across the page punctuated by illuminated medallions. They focus the readerâ€™s eyes on the sacred words in this
elaborately decorated copy of the Qurâ€™anâ€”the Muslim sacred text communicated by God (Allah) and dictated by the angel Gabriel to
the prophet Muhammad. Inscriptions in the margins document readersâ€™ interpretations of the text. The presence of the seal of the
Ottoman sultan BÄ​yezÄ«d II (r. 1481â€“1512) on various pages indicates that this lavish copy of the Qurâ€™an was sent from India to
Istanbul, sometime between the late 15th and early 16th century, perhaps as a diplomatic gift. At the time, Indian Muslims participated in a
network of commercial, diplomatic, and artistic exchanges that extended throughout Asia Europe, and Africa. This large-format,
illuminated Timurid copy of the Qur'an is believed to have been produced in northern India in the 9th century AH/15th century CE. The
manuscript opens with a series of illuminated frontispieces. The main text is written in a large, vocalized polychrome mu'aqqaq script.
Marginal explanations of the readings of particular words and phrases are in thuluth and naskhi scripts, and there is interlinear Persian
translation in red naskhi script. The fore-edge flap of the gold-tooled, brown leather binding is inscribed with verses 77 through 80 from
Chapter 56 (Surat al-waqi'ah). The seal of Sultan Bayezid II (AH 886-917 AH/1481-1512 CE) appears on fol. 8a. There is an erased

"name: Manuscripts Single Leaf of Courtiers at a Reception of Shah `Abbas I,Islamic"
This painting, Walters manuscript leaf W.691, depicts courtiers of the Safavid ruler Shah 'Abbas I (reigned 996 AH/AD 1588-1038 AH/AD
1629). It is the right side of a double-page composition, which most likely served as a frontispiece to a manuscript. Certain courtiers of
Shah 'Abbas I are identified by name. In the far upper right two men stand wearing turbans with vertical extensions held at the center,
who are identified as Alpan Bik (Beg) (in a blue robe) and Qarajaghay Khan (in a red robe). Their headdress is distinctive of high-ranking
members of court during the early 11th century AH/AD 17th. Qarajaghay Khan, an Armenian of the royal household, held a number of
political positions at court and was an important patron of the arts. Standing lower down on the right side is Shah Vardi Bik Ishik Aqasi
(literally master of the threshold, or master of ceremonies) (in a gold and black robe). An Uzbek envoy (ilchi-yi Uzbak) (in a beige and blue
patterned robe) is seated on the carpet. Falconers, grooms, and a musician (Qubad-i Kurd) standing beside a man identified as Mirza
'Umar (?) Shaykh (in a red and gold robe) are also shown. There are 2 seated female figures, identified as Gulpari and Dukhtardallalah.
The latter seems to denote a woman who procures slave girls for the palace. This single leaf has been associated with Reception at the
court of Shah`Abbas I, also housed at the Walters Art Museum (W.771, fol. 50a). However, it is unlikely that the two ever formed a
double-page composition.

"name: Manuscripts Courtiers of Shah 'Abbas I,Islamic"
Description: This painting, Walters manuscript leaf W.691, depicts courtiers of the Safavid ruler Shah 'Abbas I (reigned 996 AH/AD 1588-1038 AH/AD
1629). It is the right side of a double-page composition, which most likely served as a frontispiece to a manuscript. Certain courtiers of
Shah 'Abbas I are identified by name. In the far upper right two men stand wearing turbans with vertical extensions held at the center,
who are identified as Alpan Bik (Beg) (in a blue robe) and Qarajaghay Khan (in a red robe). Their headdress is distinctive of high-ranking
members of court during the early 11th century AH/AD 17th. Qarajaghay Khan, an Armenian of the royal household, held a number of
political positions at court and was an important patron of the arts. Standing lower down on the right side is Shah Vardi Bik Ishik Aqasi
(literally master of the threshold, or master of ceremonies) (in a gold and black robe). An Uzbek envoy (ilchi-yi Uzbak) (in a beige and blue
patterned robe) is seated on the carpet. Falconers, grooms, and a musician (Qubad-i Kurd) standing beside a man identified as Mirza
'Umar (?) Shaykh (in a red and gold robe) are also shown. There are 2 seated female figures, identified as Gulpari and Dukhtardallalah.
The latter seems to denote a woman who procures slave girls for the palace. This single leaf has been associated with Reception at the
court of Shah`Abbas I, also housed at the Walters Art Museum (W.771, fol. 50a). However, it is unlikely that the two ever formed a
double-page composition.

blue subject/section headings. In addition to illuminated titlepieces and headpieces, there are 26 illustrations. The binding is not original to
the manuscript.

Description: The queenâ€™s body is depicted in mixed perspective, with her torso frontal and her head turned to her right. She holds a double
cornucopia in her left arm. A mantle appears to be wrapped around her waist. Brown pigment colors the queenâ€™s wavy hair, arranged
in the melon hairstyle, around which she wears a diadem. Based on complete examples of the oinochoe type, the queen would have held
a patera in her outstretched right arm, and she would have been depicted full-length, with her weight on her right hip, left leg bent. To her
right would have been an altar, and behind her would have been a tapering column. Egyptian faience jugs or wine pitchers (oinochoai) of
this kind were used in the cult of the Ptolemaic rulers and always depict one of the queens of the early Ptolemaic period in high relief.
This queen can be identified as Arsinoe II (died ca. 270 BCE) by the double cornucopia she holds.

"name: Ancient Art The Book of the Faiyum,Egyptian"
Description: The Book of the Faiyum is the modern name of a text that describes the Faiyum oasis as the mythical center of prosperity and ritual. The
text was compiled during the Greco-Roman period, perhaps in the temple of the crocodile god Sobek in Shedet (Greek: Crocodilopolis;
Arabic: Medinet el-Faiyum), but it may be based on precedents from earlier periods. The most famous copy of this text, known as the
Boulaq/Hood/Amherst papyrus, consists of two papyrus scrolls with hieroglyphic text and illustrations. Portions of this papyrus are now in
the Walters Art Museum (Baltimore), the Morgan Library & Museum (New York), and the Egyptian Museum (Cairo). Besides this and
other hieroglyphic versions, there are also hieratic and Demotic copies on papyrus and an unillustrated hieroglyphic version inscribed on
the walls of the Sobek temple in Kom Ombo (Upper Egypt). The focal point of the Walters Art Museum's section of the book of the Faiyum
is a long oval representing the Faiyum lake itself. Inside the lake, images of mythological figures including the crocodile god Sobek-Re,
Osiris, and the solar child allude to stories of the creation of the world as well as the nightly regeneration of the sun god. Around the lake,
forty-two deities are depicted, each representing an important cult site in Egypt. In this way, the book functions as a map of a ceremonial
landscape centered in the Faiyum.

opens with an illuminated medallion inscribed with the author's name (fol. 1a), followed by a double-page illuminated incipit (fols. 1b-2a).
The text is illustrated with 181 paintings of different sizes that offer an interesting iconography for Tusi manuscripts. The red leather
binding is not contemporary with the manuscript and probably dates to the 13th century AH/AD 19th.

Collected by the ruling and mercantile elite, lusterware was one of the most prestigious ceramics of the medieval Islamic world. The
metallic glaze and complex firing techniques required to produce the luxury ware were developed and perfected by skilled experts. In 12th

Description: American excavations in Fustat have uncovered many examples of these unglazed earthenware jugs. This one has two inscriptional
bands in relief and an animal frieze on an arabesque ground. The middle section was made from a mold, and this suggests that these
types of jugs were made in multiples. Fustat was, in fact, acclaimed during the medieval period for ceramic mass production. It should be
noted, however, that similar examples were also discovered at sites in Syria and Afghanistan.

"name: Islamic Art Portrait of Shah Tiahmasp,Islamic"
Description: This portrait from Walters W.688 is inscribed Shah Tahmasp (died 984 AH/CE 1577), who ruled Safavid Persia from 930 AH/ CE 1524-
983 AH/CE 1526. The Safavid painter Shaykh ""Abbasi, active between 1060 AH/CE 1650 to 1095 AH/CE 1683-1684, executed a number
of portraits similar to this one, and he often signed his name in a rectangular panel, as seen in the left foreground of this painting.
Someone has erased the artist's signature on the right side of the composition. The leaf is from an album (muraqqaÊ¿) of Persian and
Indian calligraphy and paintings, most probably compiled in the thirteenth century AH / nineteenth CE. The album contains thirty-four
illustrations, three of which are attributed to the Mughal painter AbÅ« al-á¸¤asan (NÄ​dir al-al-ZamÄ​n), two to ManÅ«har, and one each to
Dawlat and á¹¢Ä​diqÄ«. There are several portraits of rulers and courtiers, as well as scenes from historical manuscripts, such as
BÄ​burnÄ​mah and GulistÄ​n by SaÊ¿dÄ«. This album is also significant for the number of works by the artist Shayk AbbÄ​sÄ«, who worked
in the eleventh century AH / seventeenth CE. The signed calligraphic pieces bear the names of Ê¿ImÄ​d al-á¸¤asanÄ« (d. 1024 AH / 1615
CE), Ê¿AlÄ« RizÌ¤Ä​-Ê¾i Ê¿AbbÄ​sÄ«, MÄ«r Ê¿AlÄ«, and Ê¿Abd al-RashÄ«d al-DaylamÄ« (d. 1081 AH / 1670-1 CE). The album was
initially in an accordion format and was later made into a codex. The lacquer binding with central ovals and pendants decorated with
flowers dates to the thirteenth century AH / nineteenth CE.

chapters 4 (Surat al-nisa'), 6 (Surat al-an'am), 7 (Surat al-a'raf), and 10 (Surat Yunus). The fragment probably dates to the 3rd century
AH/CE 9th. The text is written in an Early Abbasid (Kufic) script in dark brown ink and vocalized with red and green dots. Verse markers in
the shape of a stylized letter ha' and rosettes indicate groups of 5 and 10 verses. The text is framed by later red, blue, and gold framing
lines and a polychrome and gold floral border. The black blind-tooled leather binding with central lobed, pointed oval and pendants is
attributable to the 13th century AH/CE 19th.



"name: Manuscripts Standing Dionysus,Egyptian"
Description: Dionysus stands, head turned upward and to his left, with his weight on his right leg, his left leg relaxed and slightly bent, creating a subtle
s-curve. He is nude except for elaborate, high-laced and open-front boots. His hair is elaborate, with long tendrils hanging down his
shoulders, curls on the sides of his head, a top knot above his forehead, and the rest of his hair coiled in a bun at the back of his neck. He
wears various bands (some with fruits as appropriate to Dionysus) around this forehead, topknot, and bun. Various parts of the figure are
out of proportion, including the hands, which are large compared to the arms and torso, and the head, which is quite small and especially
in contrast to the overly large eyes and eyebrows.

"name: Ancient Art Apollo,Roman or Egyptian"
Description: Apollo stands, head turned slightly to his right, weight on his left foot with right foot advancing. His intact left hand, bent with the forearm
held out at waist level, likely held a bow; the hand, especially the thumb, seem relatively large compared to the rest of the arm. He is
nude except for the remains of a cloak around his upper backâ€”it may have draped dramatically around his front, like the Apollo
Belvedere, or hung in two lengths from his shoulders. His eyes are rather small and pierced. His hair, lacking a diadem, is pulled into a
braided roll at the back of his neck. The general stance compares well with the Piombino Apollo, and this piece may have been a
decorative object rather than a product for a temple.

",Ancient Art Plate with Deer Against Foliated Background,Islamic,,Islamic Art Head of Serapis,Egyptian,,Ancient Art Celestial
Globe,Islamic,"
Description: Stars shine on the surface of this globe, which depicts the constellations in the sky as though seen from above, rather than from the
surface of the earth. For this reason, constellations like the â€œBig Dipperâ€​ (Ursa Major) near the north pole appear backwards.
Scientists used the globe to calculate various astronomical and astrological data. While the positions of the stars allow us to calculate the
general time period the globe was made, an Arabic inscription in the Southern Hemisphere dates the object using three different calendar
systems: the Islamic calendar (Hijri), the Zoroastrian (ancient Persian religion) calendar, and one based on the death of Alexander the
Great.



"name: Islamic Art Family Group of Three,Egyptian"
Description: This statue group consists of two men and a woman and a flat relief carving of a small child, created during the Third Intermediate Period
or Late Period with a style that archaizes to the Middle Kingdom. The figures stand upon a low rectangular base with rounded corners and
against a rectangular back support with rounded corners. It is assumed, based upon other examples that these figures form a family
group, but exactly what the relationships are is uncertain due to the lack of an inscription. The costumes and body styles of the figures
archaize to the Middle Kingdom but the faces are clearly much later. The central male figure represents the person of the highest status.
He wears a long, high waisted garment tied just below his pectorals. His arms are straight and his hands are placed flat against the fronts
of his thighs. His left arm is slightly longer than his right. Both men wear a simple bag wig. The man to the left stands with his left arm
hanging straight, his hand clenched into a fist. His right arm is around the back of the central figure and only his hand is visible on the
shoulder of the central man. He wears a short, wrapped kilt with a belt. The area between his pectoral and the belt of his kilt is very rough
and is appears that originally he had a higher waisted garment which was modified. Next to the left leg of the left man there is a depiction
of a small naked child. The carving is rough, very flat raised relief. Perhaps this is a representation of the child of the left man. The woman
stands to the right of the central figure and wears a sheer ankle-length sheath gown. Her breasts, abdomen and pubic area are clearly
visible beneath her garment. Her right arm hangs at her side with her hand flat on her thigh while her left arm crosses behind the second
figure and her hand appears on his shoulder. She wears a Hathor style wig with curling lappets resting upon her breasts. She stands in
the position of the second highest status. Perhaps we have a husband and wife with an older son and either a very young second son or
a grandchild. The quality of the carving of the child suggests that this figure was added as an afterthought. A major crack runs from the
top of the piece to the bottom through the body of the central figure. The surface is quite pitted and the left front corner of the base has
been broken away.

",Ancient Art "Bowl with Enthroned Figure, Courtiers, and Harpies "name: Islamic"
Description: Minaâ€™i is a modern collectorsâ€™ term for ceramics made in Iran during the late 12th to early 13th centuries. The term minaâ€™i,
translates as â€œenamelledâ€​ in Persian, designating the colored glass pigments used to paint detailed figural decoration on vessels or
tiles, which were then fixed on the ceramic base by multiple firings. The use of a wide range of colors, including turquoise, red, green,
purple, and black, also led these types of ceramics to be called by the Persian term â€œhaft rang,â€​ or â€œseven colors.â€​ These
colorful compositions created complex narrative scenes which paralleled manuscript painting. Minaâ€™i ware scenes often depict courtly
pursuits, such as feasting, fighting, or poetry and music performances. The combination of leisurely activities with more warrior-like
occupations, such as the hunt, was frequently used in the medieval Persian iconography of kingship. The royal figure depicted here is
seen seated on a central throne. He is surrounded by one courtier on either side, their heads slightly bent in a gesture of deference. This
courtly scene is surrounding by a running band of six harpies. The inscription on the inner rim is in kufic. The cursive inscription on the
bowlâ€™s exterior is written in calligraphic style of naskhi.

Description: Minaâ€™i is a modern collectorsâ€™ term for ceramics made in Iran during the late 12th to early 13th centuries. The term minaâ€™i,
translates as â€œenamelledâ€​ in Persian, designating the colored glass pigments used to paint detailed figural decoration on vessels or
tiles, which were then fixed on the ceramic base by multiple firings. The use of a wide range of colors, including turquoise, red, green,
purple, and black, also led these types of ceramics to be called by the Persian term â€œhaft rang,â€​ or â€œseven colors.â€​ Minaâ€™i
ware scenes often depict courtly pursuits, such as feasting, fighting, or poetry and music performances. These colorful compositions
created complex narrative scenes which paralleled manuscript painting. This footed bowl features relatively rare composition of a single
camel at the center surrounded by a camel caravan led by a driver on foot. The bowl also features two pseudo-inscriptions in different
calligraphic styles: in kufic on the interior, and naskhi on the exterior.

Description: Minaâ€™i is a modern collectorsâ€™ term for ceramics made in Iran during the late 12th to early 13th centuries. The term minaâ€™i,
translates as â€œenamelledâ€​ in Persian, designating the colored glass pigments used to paint detailed figural decoration on vessels or

",Ancient Art """Katar"" (Fist of Punch Dagger)"name: Islamic; Hindu"
Description: This type of dagger, characteristic of India and Southeast Asia, has an H-shaped grip so that the userâ€™s knuckles are perpendicular to
the wide blade, giving the dagger the strength and stability of the balled fist when thrust directly at the opponent. The shape remained
popular for centuries, so precise dating is difficult. The shape and attention to ornament distinguish the Indian fist dagger, known as a
""katar,"" from the typical European dagger, which is more flexible in its use but rarely so exuberantly decorated. By at least the later
1500s, Indian fist daggers were prized by European noble collectors. Inventories of the collections of Archduke Ferdinand II of Austria
(1529â€“95), who owned more than one, suggest that he was fascinated by the weaponry of other cultures.

axe-head curve inwards, though not to the same degree (the bottom side is curved more than the top), resulting in an asymmetrical axe-
head with a skewed cutting end. The handle and cord attaching the axe-head to the handle are modern. There are small orange-like
patches on the lion on both sides of the axe-head; there is more on the side where the lion is facing left. There are similar patches on the
inside of the border of the axe-head. There appears to be little wear on the cutting surface of the axe-head.



"name: Ancient Art Satis standing,Egyptian,,Ancient Art Imhotep,Egyptian,,Ancient Art Cat Reliquary,Egyptian"
Description: This statuette of a seated cat is a hollow cast from bronze. The tail of the cat curls around the proper right side of the body. The cat has a
sweet face with large eyes. Both ears are pierced for earrings, most likely of gold, which are now missing. The ornaments worn by the
cat, including a three row beaded collar, an wadjet eye amulet suspended on a cord and a scarab beetle on the top of its' head are all
incised into the surface. Conservation work to counter-act inroads of spontaneous corrosion (also known commonly as ""bronze
disease""), uncovered the remains of a fetal cat within the sandy matrix inside the hollow of the body of the cat. (Fink and Kopp, fig. 2)
Both the fill and the bones were determined to be ancient. The matrix was composed of sand and an alkali, probably natron, which may
have been used to embalm the cat. These elements cemented to create a hard, faience-like material. Electrolytic preservation stabilized
the chloridic surface, removing the green patina that had built up (see Fink and Kopp for technical details). The cavity opening is located
beneath the back quarters of the cat. The cat does not have an original base, but rectangular tangs may be noted beneath the front feet
and the base of the tail. After conservation the body was treated with wax and the opening was refilled with a sand-wax mixture in order to
keep the weakened bronze body from collapsing upon itself. An ancient dent at the lower back was filled and tinted to match the body
(Fink and Kopp, p. 114).

"name: Ancient Art Jug with Band of Rosettes at Body and Neck,Islamic"

tiles, which were then fixed on the ceramic base by multiple firings. The use of a wide range of colors, including turquoise, red, green,
purple, and black, also led these types of ceramics to be called by the Persian term â€œhaft rang,â€​ or â€œseven colors.â€​ This jug is a
type of minaâ€™i ware called â€œlavjardina,â€​ a term derived from the Persian word for the blue stone lapis lazuli (lavjard). Rather than

"name: Ancient Art Tile with Image of a Man,Islamic"
Description: The tile of white ground and polychrome decoration is of composite or stone paste body with overglaze colors applied by cuerda seca (dry
cord) technique. This seventeenth-century tile was once part of a larger figural composition that decorated a building in early modern Iran,
most likely in the Persian capital at Isfahan. The palette and cuerda seca technique of the tile exemplify ceramic manufacture of Safavid
Persia (1501â€“1722), where the court and wealthy merchants commissioned palaces sheathed in such polychrome narrative tiles. A
popular theme for architectural compositions was men and women feasting outdoors; it is likely that the present tile was part of such a
compostion, which finds many parallels in seventeenth-century arts of the book. The Safavid period is appreciated as an epoch of great
artistic and literary output, when images of youthful figures, like the one seen on this tile, would conjure poetic verses celebrating wine,
poetry, and the beloved.

Description: This set of two objects are a pair of composite, over life-size eyes that would most likely have been inserted into a stone or wooden
statue. These separately made eyes, combining several different materials to represent the anatomy and coloration of human eyes. The
copper alloy section also creates the extended cosmetic eye line frequently found in Egyptian art. The copper alloy surrounds in the form
of cosmetic eye lines taper toward the back, which would have been inserted into a figural sculpture.



"name: Ancient Art Winged Scarab,Egyptian"
Description: The ancient Egyptians believed that the dung beetle, the Scarabaeus sacer, was one of the manifestations of the sun god.
Representations of these beetles were used as amulets, and for ritual or administrative purposes. Winged scarabs were part of the amulet
set of a mummy. This example has a flat, undecorated bottom, and is executed in one piece. The beetle is glazed dark blue, and the
wings light green. The back of the scarab is flat, the highest points are pronotum (dorsal plate of the prothorax) and elytron (wing cases).
There are no separation lines between the different parts of the back. The head section consists of the semicircular head, trapezoidal side
plates, and a large trapezoidal clypeus (front plate). The slightly raised extremities are modeled. Four small drill-holes flank the body, two
at each side. The wings are somewhat asymmetrically, and the right one is smaller than the left. They display a tripartite surface structure.
The inner part shows facet design, the middle and outer part a feather pattern. A large drill-hole exists at each tip of the wings. Such
winged scarabs are funerary amulets, and were originally attached to mummy wrappings. The amulet should assure the renewal of the
deceased in the afterlife by the sun god. Winged scarabs consist mostly of several pieces, the scarab and two attached wings (e.g.
Walters Art Museum, 42.1430, 42.1448), one-piece examples are more rare.

"name: Islamic Art Turban Ornament,Islamic"
Description: The three-part pin decorated the front of a Muslim man's turban. Mimicking feathers, the gilt coiled wires, once topped with pearls, would
have waved with movement. The ornament is decorated with red stones. Are the gem stones rubies, garnets or glass? All the red stones
are rubies, except one triangular stone at the base of the pin above the two prongs. Probably a replacement, the triangular stone does
not fluoresce and was determined to be glass based on its composition, hardness and inclusions. The rubies or spinels fluoresce bright
pink under UV light. Visually their color is further heightened by silver foil coated with a bright pink pigment or dye that is positioned behind
the stones. The foil with traces of pink is visible where a ruby has been lost.
